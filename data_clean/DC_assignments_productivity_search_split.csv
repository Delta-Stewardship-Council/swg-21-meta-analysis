"1","algal extracellular release in river-floodplain dissolved organic matter: response of extracellular enzymatic activity during a post-flood period","River-floodplain systems are susceptible to rapid hydrological events. Changing hydrological connectivity of the floodplain generates a broad range of conditions, from lentic to lotic. This creates a mixture of allochthonously and autochthonously derived dissolved organic matter (DOM). Autochthonous DOM, including photosynthetic extracellular release (PER), is an important source supporting bacterial secondary production (BSP). Nonetheless, no details are available regarding microbial extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA) as a response to PER under variable hydrological settings in river-floodplain systems. To investigate the relationship between bacterial and phytoplankton components, we therefore used EEA as a tool to track the microbial response to non-chromophoric, but reactive and ecologically important DOM. The study was conducted in three floodplain subsystems with distinct hydrological regimes (Danube Floodplain National Park, Austria). The focus was on the post-flood period. Enhanced %PER (up to 48% of primary production) in a hydrologically isolated subsystem was strongly correlated with beta-glucosidase, which was related to BSP. This shows that in disconnected floodplain backwaters with high terrestrial input BSP can also be driven by autochthonous carbon sources (PER). In a semi-isolated section, in the presence of fresh labile material from primary producers, enhanced activity of phenol oxidase was observed. In frequently flooded river-floodplain systems, BSP was mainly driven by enzymatic degradation of particulate primary production. Our research demonstrates that EEA measurements are an excellent tool to describe the coupling between bacteria and phytoplankton, which cannot be deciphered when focusing solely on chromophoric DOM.","Sieczko, Anna; Maschek, Maria; Peduzzi, Peter","Scholarly Journals",2015,6,"BIOSIS:PREV201500284917","wos",4,"DC","LY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"2","consistent trophic patterns among fishes in lagoon and channel habitats of a tropical floodplain river: evidence from stable isotopes","The relationship between food web dynamics and hydrological connectivity in rivers should be strongly influenced by annual flood pulses that affect primary production dynamics and movement of organic matter and consumer taxa. We sampled basal production sources and fishes from connected lagoons and the main channel of a low-gradient, floodplain river within the Orinoco River Basin in Venezuela. Stable isotope analysis was used to model the contribution of four basal production sources to fishes, and to examine patterns of mean trophic position during the falling-water period of the annual flood cycle. IsoSource, a multi-source mixing model, indicated that proportional contributions from production sources to fish assemblages were similar in lagoons and the main channel. Although distributions differed, the means for trophic positions of fish assemblages as well as individual species were similar between the two habitats. These findings contradict recent food web studies conducted in temperate floodplain rivers that described significant differences in trophic positions of fishes from slackwater and floodplain versus main channel habitats. Low between-habitat trophic variation in this tropical river probably results from an extended annual flood pulse (ca. 5 mo.) that allows mixing of sestonic and allochthonous basal production sources and extensive lateral movements of fishes throughout the riverscape.","Roach, KA;Winemiller, KO;Layman, CA;Zeug, S C","Scholarly Journals",2009,35,"20869414","proquest",11,"DC","ES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"3","echoes of a flood pulse: short-term effects of record flooding of the illinois river on floodplain lakes under ecological restoration","The flood pulse drives primary productivity, biotic communities, and abiotic processes in large river systems; however, the effects of floods on restored floodplain lakes and associated wetlands are poorly understood. Record flooding of the Illinois River, Illinois, in 2013 reconnected two floodplain preserves under restoration that had been disconnected from the river by levees for &gt;80 years. Differences in hydrological connections between sites created a natural experiment where field-based data collection could be employed to document flood effects. Levee failure and subsequent river connection at Merwin Preserve increased nutrient capture and floodwater retention, shifted microbial and invertebrate communities, increased fish species richness, spawning and nursery habitat, and stimulated production of moist-soil plant communities during summer drawdown that provided foraging habitat for spring-migrating waterfowl. However, increased hydrologic connectivity during the growing season resulted in loss of submersed vegetation and habitat for autumn-migrating waterfowl. In contrast, river water overtopped the levee at Emiquon Preserve during a 6-day event that resulted in marginal changes in the bacterial community and negligible changes in water quality and community diversity. Tradeoffs among ecological services should be carefully considered when reconnection of highly altered rivers to restored lakes and wetlands is proposed.","Lemke, Michael J;Hagy, Heath M;Dungey, Keenan;Casper, Andrew F;Lemke, A Maria;VanMiddlesworth, T D;Kent, Angela","Scholarly Journals",2017,804,"2010228466","proquest",18,"DC","PG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"4","environmental factors affecting incorporation of terrestrial material into large river food webs","Three enduring conceptual models make predictions regarding the basal production sources supporting the upper food web of rivers: the River Continuum Concept, the Flood Pulse Concept, and the Riverine Productivity Model. Sources of primary production supporting metazoan biomass might best be understood by using a pluralistic approach that views basal sources as a dependent variable and key physicochemical and hydrological factors as independent variables. Here, I review studies in which chemical markers (stable-isotope and fatty-acid analyses) were used to estimate dominant primary producers contributing to consumer biomass in large rivers and evaluate associated independent variables (e.g., hydrologic regime, turbidity, concentration of dissolved organic matter, floodplain vegetation, lateral connectivity, and upstream impoundment) that have been hypothesized to contribute to variation in basal production sources. My review shows that C₄ grasses rarely support riverine metazoans and that algae are the predominant source of C supporting upper trophic levels of large rivers worldwide. However, I also found that many consumers assimilate material from C(3) plants in rivers with high sediment loads and low transparency during high-flow pulses. Exceptions to this pattern occur when river reaches are downstream from an impoundment, in which case, algae assume greater importance. Terrestrial C(3) plants also subsidize consumers in rivers with high dissolved organic matter concentrations via the microbial loop and, in other rivers, after periods of high discharge or leaf fall that increase the amount of terrestrial material in the particulate organic matter pool. I highlight the natural causes of differences in turbidity and dissolved organic matter among large rivers and the importance of transported materials as a source of nutrients for ecologically and economically important fish species.","Roach, Katherine A","Scholarly Journals",2013,32,"1753433423","proquest",25,"DC","RP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"5","hydrologic fragmentation-induced eutrophication in dove sound, upper florida keys, usa","Anthropogenic impacts to island systems can have deleterious effects on coastal aquatic ecosystems. These effects can alter water quality, primary production as well as habitat. Land development often fragments hydrologic connectivity within aquatic ecosystems forcing alterations in nutrient transport and increases the potential for eutrophication. Dove Sound, a tidal lagoon located in the Upper Florida Keys on Key Largo, has been subjected to anthropogenic influences of land development during the last century. To investigate these influences a short sediment core was collected from within Dove Sound and investigated using Ã‚²Ã‚¹Ã¢°Pb dating, stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, and sedimentary pigments. Results indicated that Dove Sound has undergone eutrophication and the primary producer community structure has shifted from dominantly macrophytic to a system that supports substantial algal production. While septic waste was a possible source for eutrophication, low ÃŽ´Ã‚¹Ã¢µN did not support this conclusion. However, the timing of the shifts in Dove Sound along with indicators of anoxia leads to the conclusion that fragmentation caused by the construction of a railroad was the root cause. The hydrologic fragmentation reduced the flushing rates, thereby enhancing anoxic conditions in the system and increasing the internal nutrient loading.","Harmon, Thomas S;Smoak, Joseph M;Waters, Matthew N;Sanders, Christian J","Scholarly Journals",2014,71,"1999933753","proquest",32,"DC","ES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"6","influence of flood connectivity on bottomland hardwood forest productivity in central ohio","Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in response to flooding and other environmental variables was evaluated at a 5.2-ha bottomland hardwood forest along the Olentangy River in central Ohio, USA. The forest is composed of two distinct sections that were hydrologically enhanced in 2001. To approximate natural flooding, the north section was enhanced by cutting three breaches in a more than 70-year-old artificial levee. A fourth breach was cut from a natural riverbank in the south section to connect a lateral swale and augment the existing flood regime. The objective of this study was to evaluate various factors that might affect forest productivity after restoration. In 2004, ANPP for the forest was estimated at 847 plus or minus 50 g m super(-2) yr super(-1) (807 plus or minus 86 g m super(-2) yr super(-1) in the north section and 869 plus or minus 86 g m super(-2) yr super(-1) in the south section). Mean ANPP for the entire forest was similar to an estimate prior to restoration and still below productivity levels reported at other bottomland forests along the Olentnagy River and throughout the Midwest U.S. As part of this study, the influence of flood connectivity and other variables on intra-forest ANPP were also examined. Using daily river-stage data and by monitoring study plots at various flood stages, we estimated the number of days each plot was connected to the river. A significant and positive relationship was detected between plot ANPP and the number of days connected to the river during the 2004 water year (Oct. 2003-Sept. 2004). Forest ANPP was also significantly related to total tree basal area and topographic variability.","Anderson, C J;Mitsch, W J","Scholarly Journals",2008,108,"21050124","proquest",39,"DC","PG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"7","linkages between flow regime, biota, and ecosystem processes: implications for river restoration","River restoration guided by research Human activities have altered the flow regimes of many of Earth's rivers, with negative impacts on biodiversity, water quality, and ecological processes. In a Review, Palmer and Ruhi explain how restoration designs now attempt to mimic ecologically important aspects of natural flow regimes, guided by insights into how variations in flow affect biota and ecosystem processes. To be successful, such efforts must go beyond accounting for flood pulses to restore natural flow variability and achieve hydrological connectivity between a river and its surroundings. Science , this issue p. eaaw2087 BACKGROUND Early civilizations developed around seasonal river floodplains, and the natural rhythm of rivers remains critical to humans today. We use streams and rivers to meet drinking water, irrigation, and hydropower needs by storing and moving water in complex ways, at the times and places of our choosing. Consequently, many of Earth’s rivers have flow regimes that are “unnatural” in magnitude, frequency, duration, and timing. The rise in river degradation globally has motivated research on the link between hydrologic alteration and declines in valued biota. At the same time, largely fueled by new technologies and methods, research has expanded to understand the patterns in, and drivers of, riverine processes like primary production, in both near-pristine and degraded rivers. A third line of research, stymied by how difficult it has been to restore degraded rivers, has called for process-based restoration, building on knowledge from the other two research thrusts. Today’s hydroecological science seeks to understand the mechanisms whereby flow regimes affect biota and ecosystem processes, and the interplay between them, in a three-way interaction we call the flow-biota-ecosystem processes nexus. ADVANCES By shifting the focus from static patterns at sites to dynamic processes along river networks, advances are being made to understand the interactions and feedbacks at the nexus. Fueled by increasingly available time-series data and novel modeling, emerging research ranges from studies on regime-based properties such as flow periodicity and its change, to studies on river network structure and associated spatial variation in flow and water chemistry. These studies demonstrate how flow variability influences long-term persistence of riverine assemblages, and they are disentangling the direct effects of flow on communities and ecosystem processes from its indirect effects (e.g., via species interactions, light-blocking turbidity). Changes in temporal patterns in flow magnitudes can increase risk of community collapse and alter key ecosystem processes such as primary production. Growing research shows that storm flows not only enhance inputs and downstream export of terrestrially derived carbon to rivers but, when associated with sustained hydrologic connectivity with soils, exert particular influence on water chemistry and biogeochemical processes that can influence food webs. Increased availability of environmental sensors has stimulated research, showing that extreme flows may impart disproportionate impacts on stream metabolism, but the relationship can depend on the predictability of those flows. Research combining changes in flow patterns with stable isotope analyses is revealing how temporal fluctuations in habitat, and in the quality and quantity of basal resources, influence trophic pathways and resulting food-web structure. Evidence suggests that restoring particular facets of a flow regime can produce desirable conservation outcomes, but context is paramount. Restoration actions going beyond discrete flow events and enhancing groundwater-influenced river habitat or redirecting subsurface flow paths may be critical in future climates. OUTLOOK Our understanding of the flow-biota-ecosystem processes nexus is still incomplete and is a frontier research topic. Challenges include connecting organismal and ecosystem-level processes, and understanding the role of microbial communities as intermediaries. Capturing the effects of watershed-level physical and biogeochemical heterogeneity, and parsing out direct, indirect, or cascading effects of flow alteration on biota and processes would also reduce uncertainty in restoration outcomes, particularly in novel, nonstationary environments. Understanding how much flow restoration alone can achieve in urban watersheds is an urgent need, as is translating findings from hydroecology to design green infrastructure and flow release programs from reservoirs. These management tools may offer growing opportunities to experiment with flow regimes, which will assist in refining process-based river restoration. Both solid science, and effective translation into practice will be needed to curb the fast pace of global river ecosystem degradation. River ecosystems are highly biodiverse, influence global biogeochemical cycles, and provide valued services. However, humans are increasingly degrading fluvial ecosystems by altering their streamflows. Effective river restoration requires advancing our mechanistic understanding of how flow regimes affect biota and ecosystem processes. Here, we review emerging advances in hydroecology relevant to this goal. Spatiotemporal variation in flow exerts direct and indirect control on the composition, structure, and dynamics of communities at local to regional scales. Streamflows also influence ecosystem processes, such as nutrient uptake and transformation, organic matter processing, and ecosystem metabolism. We are deepening our understanding of how biological processes, not just static patterns, affect and are affected by stream ecosystem processes. However, research on this nexus of flow-biota-ecosystem processes is at an early stage. We illustrate this frontier with evidence from highly altered regulated rivers and urban streams. We also identify research challenges that should be prioritized to advance process-based river restoration.",NA,"Scholarly Journals",2019,365,"2296393153","proquest",46,"DC","PG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"8","opening the tap: increased riverine connectivity strengthens marine food web pathways","Reduction of ecosystem connectivity has long-lasting impacts on food webs. Anadromous fish, which migrate from marine to freshwater ecosystems to complete reproduction, have seen their historically larger ecosystem role undercut by widespread riverine habitat fragmentation and other impacts mainly derived from anthropogenic sources. The result has been extensive extirpations and increased susceptibility to a suite of environmental factors that currently impede recovery. Under this present-day context of reduced productivity and connectivity, aggressive management actions and enforcement of catch limits including bycatch caps and complete moratoria on harvest have followed. What remains less understood are the implications of changes to food webs that co-occurred. What benefits restoration could provide in terms of ecosystem functioning in relation to economic costs associated with dam removal and remediation is unknown and can limit the scope and value of restoration activities. Here we employ, historical landscape-based biomass estimates of anadromous alosine for the first time in an ecosystem modeling of the Northeast US large marine ecosystem ( LME), to evaluate the value of improving connectivity by measuring the increase in energy flow and population productivity. We compared a restored alosine model to a contemporary model, analyzing the impacts of the potential increase of connectivity between riverine and oceanic systems. There was the potential for a moderate biomass increase of piscivorous species with high economic value, including Atlantic cod, and for a major increase for species of conservation concern such as pelagic sharks, seabirds and marine mammals. Our study highlights the benefits of increased connectivity between freshwater and ocean ecosystems. We demonstrate the significant role anadromous forage fish could play in improving specific fisheries and overall ecosystem functioning, mainly through the diversification of species capable of transferring primary production to upper trophic levels, adding to benefits associated with their restoration.","Dias, Beatriz S.; Frisk, Michael G.; Jordaan, Adrian","Scholarly Journals",2019,14,"BIOSIS:PREV201900594533","wos",53,"DC","MB",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"9","river and wetland food webs in australia's wet-dry tropics: general principles and implications for management","The tropical rivers of northern Australia have received international and national recognition for their high ecological and cultural values. Unlike many tropical systems elsewhere in the world and their temperate Australian counterparts, they have largely unmodified flow regimes and are comparatively free from the impacts associated with intensive land use. However, there is growing demand for agricultural development and existing pressures, such as invasive plants and feral animals, threaten their ecological integrity. Using the international literature to provide a conceptual framework and drawing on limited published and unpublished data on rivers in northern Australia, we have derived five general principles about food webs and related ecosystem processes that both characterise tropical rivers of northern Australia and have important implications for their management. These are: ( 1) the seasonal hydrology is a strong driver of ecosystem processes and food-web structure; ( 2) hydrological connectivity is largely intact and underpins important terrestrial-aquatic food-web subsidies; ( 3) river and wetland food webs are strongly dependent on algal production; ( 4) a few common macroconsumer species have a strong influence on benthic food webs; and ( 5) omnivory is widespread and food chains are short. The implications of these ecosystem attributes for the management and protection of tropical rivers and wetlands of northern Australian are discussed in relation to known threats. These principles provide a framework for the formation of testable hypotheses in future research programmes.","Douglas, Michael M.; Bunn, Stuart E.; Davies, Peter M.","Scholarly Journals",2005,56,"BIOSIS:PREV200510141744","wos",60,"DC","RP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"10","the effects of river floodwaters on floodplain wetland water quality and diatom assemblages","We investigated the effects of river floodpulses on the water chemistry and diatom assemblages in a floodplain wetland. During the two year study period (November 2003-September 2005), the river and wetland exhibited three periods of surface hydrologic connectivity. The impacts of flooding depended on flood magnitude and duration. Both the long/high magnitude and short/high magnitude floods thoroughly mixed river and wetland waters, with conductivity, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus in the wetland decreasing to levels similar to the river. In contrast, the short/low magnitude flood did not mix water chemistry. Wetland conductivity, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus remained elevated. Changes in algal biomass followed changes in water chemistry with the high magnitude floods producing conditions unfavorable for algal growth. Algal biomass decreased in the wetland coinciding with the two high magnitude floods. Increases in algal biomass coincided with the short/low magnitude flood. Wetland and river water column diatom assemblages were dominated by periphytic taxa. The diatom assemblage in the river and wetland were distinct, except during the short/high magnitude flood. During this period, floodwaters brought diatoms into the wetland and both systems were dominated by planktonic centric taxa. Similar diatom taxa were observed in the wetland water column assemblage and the assemblage collected in settling chambers, although their relative abundances varied. Shifts in the settling diatom assemblage coincided with periods of flooding, indicating that river floodwaters leave a discernable signal within this assemblage. Our findings indicate that caution should be exercised when using diatom-based bioassessment in frequently flooded wetlands as the wetland diatom assemblage is influenced by river floodwaters and changes may depend on the duration and magnitude of flooding.","Weilhoefer, Christine L.; Pan, Yangdong; Eppard, Sara","Scholarly Journals",2008,28,"BIOSIS:PREV200800491563","wos",67,"DC","RP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"11","trophic structure of apex fish communities in closed versus leaky lakes of arctic alaska","Despite low species diversity and primary production, trophic structure (e.g., top predator species, predator size) is surprisingly variable among Arctic lakes. We investigated trophic structure in lakes of arctic Alaska containing arctic char Salvelinus alpinus using stomach contents and stable isotope ratios in two geographically-close but hydrologically-distinct lake clusters to investigate how these fish may interact and compete for limited food resources. Aside from different lake connectivity patterns (‘leaky’ versus ‘closed’), differing fish communities (up to five versus only two species) between lake clusters allowed us to test trophic hypotheses including: (1) arctic char are more piscivorous, and thereby grow larger and obtain higher trophic positions, in the presence of other fish species; and, (2) between arctic char size classes, resource polymorphism is more prominent, and thereby trophic niches are narrower and overlap less, in the absence of other predators. Regardless of lake cluster, we observed little direct evidence of arctic char consuming other fishes, but char were larger (mean TL = 468 vs 264 mm) and trophic position was higher (mean TP = 4.0 vs 3.8 for large char) in lakes with other fishes. Further, char demonstrated less intraspecific overlap when other predators were present whereas niche overlap was up to 100% in closed, char only lakes. As hydrologic characteristics (e.g., lake connectivity, water temperatures) will change across the Arctic owing to climate change, our results provide insight regarding potential concomitant changes to fish interactions and increase our understanding of lake trophic structure to guide management and conservation goals.","Klobucar, Stephen L;Budy, Phaedra","Scholarly Journals",2020,194,"2551966841","proquest",74,"DC","CP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"62","resilience to drought of dryland wetlands threatened by climate change","Dryland wetlands are resilient ecosystems that can adapt to extreme periodic drought-flood episodes. Climate change projections show increased drought severity in drylands that could compromise wetland resilience and reduce important habitat services. These recognized risks have been difficult to evaluate due to our limited capacity to establish comprehensive relationships between flood-drought episodes and vegetation responses at the relevant spatiotemporal scales. We address this issue by integrating detailed spatiotemporal flood-drought simulations with remotely sensed vegetation responses to water regimes in a dryland wetland known for its highly variable inundation. We show that a combination of drought tolerance and dormancy strategies allow wetland vegetation to recover after droughts and recolonize areas invaded by terrestrial species. However, climate change scenarios show widespread degradation during drought and limited recovery after floods. Importantly, the combination of degradation extent and increase in drought duration is critical for the habitat services wetland systems provide for waterbirds and fish.","Sandi, Steven G;Rodriguez, Jose F;Saintilan, Neil;Wen, Li;Kuczera, George;Riccardi, Gerardo;Saco, Patricia M","Scholarly Journals",2020,10,"2431814975","proquest",59,"LY","DC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"36","hydrological connectivity drives patterns of macroinvertebrate biodiversity in floodplain rivers of the australian wet /dry tropics","1. Floodplain rivers in Australia's wet/dry tropics are regarded as being among the most ecologically intact and bio-diverse lotic ecosystems in the world, yet there have been relatively few community-based studies of their aquatic fauna. 2. To investigate relationships between hydrological connectivity and biodiversity in the region, macroinvertebrates were collected from sites within two contrasting floodplain rivers, the 'tropical' Gregory River and 'dryland' Flinders River systems, during the dry season and analysed at various spatial scales. A subset of sites was re-sampled in the following dry season to explore temporal variation. The fauna consisted of 124 morphotaxa, dominated by gatherers and the Insecta. 3. As predicted, hydrological connectivity (the lotic or lentic status of waterbodies) had a major influence on macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and diversity, both in space and time. Assemblages from waterbodies with similar connection histories were most alike, and beta-diversity between assemblages was greatest between lotic and lentic waterbodies, tending to increase with increasing spatial separation. 4. At smaller spatial scales, a number of within-waterbody, habitat and water quality characteristics were important for explaining variation (61%) in the taxonomic organization of assemblages, and characteristics associated with primary productivity and habitat diversity were important for explaining variation (45%) in the functional organization of assemblages. However, much of the small-scale environmental variation across the study region appeared to be related to broad-scale variation in hydrological connectivity, which had both direct and indirect effects on macroinvertebrate assemblages. 5. Conservation of the biodiversity in Australia's wet/dry tropics may depend on conserving the natural variation in hydrological connectivity and the unregulated flow of floodplain rivers.","Leigh, Catherine;Sheldon, Fran","Scholarly Journals",2009,54,"46164494","proquest",35,"RP","DC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"27","flood disturbance affects macroinvertebrate food chain length in an alluvial river floodplain","Characterising food-web responses to environmental factors could greatly improve our understanding of environment-biota relationships, and especially in floodplains where trophic interactions can be particularly important during phases of hydrological disconnection. The effects of floodplain hydrology and environmental attributes on structural aspects of biotic assemblages have been extensively studied, but responses at the functional level remain largely unknown. Here, we characterised a central aspect of food-web architecture, the food chain length, as the maximum trophic position within 24 macroinvertebrate communities of parafluvial habitats in the Maggia river floodplain, in Switzerland. We investigated how the food chain length changed with different levels of habitat size, primary productivity and disturbance, the three factors potentially affecting food chain length in both theoretical and empirical studies. We found that food chain length was lower in frequently flooded habitats and immediately after a flood. We also showed that trophic omnivory, where predators fed at lower trophic levels after flooding, and in more frequently flooded habitats, may explain these changes. These findings show that trophic omnivory may explain how predators resist disturbance and are maintained in highly dynamic landscapes. More importantly, given that trophic omnivory may overall weaken trophic linkages and thus increase food-web stability, this suggests that it could be a key mechanism in sustaining biodiversity in river floodplains.","Chanut, Pierre C.
