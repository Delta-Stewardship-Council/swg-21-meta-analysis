"2","abiotic variability among different aquatic systems of the central amazon floodplain during drought and flood events","This paper examines water properties from lakes, channels and paleo-channels located in Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve, in Central Amazon floodplain, Amazonas, Brazil. The authors analysed surface temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, transparency, suspended inorganic and organic matter, chlorophyll-a, pheophytin, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, organic and inorganic carbon in 2009 high water phase, 2009 and 2010 low water phases. Multivariate statistical analyses of 24 aquatic systems (6 ressacas, 12 lakes and 6 channels, 142 samples) were applied to the variables. First, they analysed the entire set of variables to test for differences among phases of the hydrological year and types of aquatic systems using a PERMANOVA two-way crossed design. The results showed that the all measured limnological variables are distinct regarding both factors: types of aquatic systems and hydrological phases. In general, the magnitude and amplitude of all variables were higher in the low water phase than in the high water phase, except for water transparency in all aquatic system's types.","Affonso, A G;Queiroz, H L",2015,"ES","LY","N","central Amazon floodplain","Y","surface temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, transparency, suspended inorganic and organic matter, chlorophyll-a, pheophytin, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, organic and inorganic carbon","hydrologic phase (stage?)","Y",NA,"chl_3",NA
"3","abundance and biomass responses of microbial food web components to hydrology and environmental gradients within a floodplain of the river danube","This study investigated the relationships of time-dependent hydrological variability and selected microbial food web components. Samples were collected monthly from the KopaÄki Rit floodplain in Croatia, over a period of 19Â months, for analysis of bacterioplankton abundance, cell size and biomass; abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and nanophytoplankton; and concentration of chlorophyll a. Similar hydrological variability at different times of the year enabled partition of seasonal effects from hydrological changes on microbial community properties. The results suggested that, unlike some other studies investigating sites with different connectivity, bacterioplankton abundance, and phytoplankton abundance and biomass increased during lentic conditions. At increasing water level, nanophytoplankton showed lower sensitivity to disturbance in comparison with total phytoplankton biomass: this could prolong autotrophic conditions within the floodplain. Bacterioplankton biomass, unlike phytoplankton, was not impacted by hydrology. The bacterial biomass less affected by hydrological changes can be an important additional food component for the floodplain food web. The results also suggested a mechanism controlling bacterial cell size independent of hydrology, as bacterial cell size was significantly decreased as nanoflagellate abundance increased. Hydrology, regardless of seasonal sucession, has the potential to structure microbial food webs, supporting microbial development during lentic conditions. Conversely, other components appear unaffected by hydrology or may be more strongly controlled by biotic interactions. This research, therefore, adds to understanding on microbial food web interactions in the context of flood and flow pulses in river-floodplain ecosystems.","Palijan, Goran",2012,"MB","PG","n","floodplain","y","bacterioplankton abundance, size, and biomass; abundance of nanoflaggellates and nanophytoplankton; concentration of cholorphyll a","unclear; water level","y","The information in the abstract does not seem directly relevant (no clear connectivity metric, focus on microbial community), but mentions measuring chlorophyll a, so maybe worth looking at full text","chl_4",NA

"5","aquatic metabolism short-term response to the flood pulse in a mediterranean floodplain","The pulsing of river discharge affects biodiversity and productivity of whole river-floodplain ecosystems, triggering the transport, storage and processing of carbon. In this study we investigate the short-term changes in water chemistry and net pelagic metabolism (NEP) in two floodplain lakes in response to a flood pulse. The two oxbow lakes investigated in the floodplain of the Mediterranean Ebro River (NE Spain) showed a clear temporal shift in their metabolic balance, controlled by the river discharge and associated changes in water physical and chemical characteristics. Water chemistry (turbidity, water organic matter, chlorophyll a and nutrients concentration) returned to pre-flood values after 4 days, highlighting the resilience of the ecosystem to flood pulses. Lake NEP was depressed before and during floods to a minimum of -34 mg O-2 m(-3) h(-1), and increased after the flood pulse to a maximum of +463 mg O-2 m(-3) h(-1). The phytoplankton assemblage showed before and after floods a replacement of autotrophic species (e.g. Chlorophyceans) by mixotrophic organisms (e.g. Cryptophyceans, Euglenoids). A linear mixed effects model identified abiotic factors, particularly temperature and river discharge, as significant predictors of the net aquatic metabolism and community respiration during flood conditions. Our results suggest that the role of the Ebro floodplain lakes as sources or sinks of C is complex and relative to the time scale investigated, depending strongly on the river discharge dynamics and the transport of limiting nutrients (phosphorus).","Gallardo, B.; Espanol, C.; Comin, F.

They were both covered by macrophytes and they had different hydrological connectivity to the Danube. The six sampling campaigns from April to October 2014 included parallel samples from the Danube River at Mohacs, Hungary. Bacterial abundance was the highest in spring and in Mocskos-Danube, followed by Mohacs and Riha.

We evaluated carryover effects of hydroperiod length (50-62 days) on amphibian survival, developmental rates, and locomotor performance using a model organism, the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), through aquatic and terrestrial mesocosm experiments with individual tests of locomotor performance. We found that shorter hydroperiods (50 days) had low larval survival (0.44 ± 0.03) compared to the 62-day hydroperiod (0.91 ± 0.09) and increased developmental rates, resulting in smaller sizes at metamorphosis. We did not find evidence of carryover effects on terrestrial survival three months post-metamorphosis with all hydroperiod treatments showing high terrestrial survival (0.88 ± 0.07). However, post-metamorphic frogs from the longer hydroperiod treatments grew faster and larger compared to individuals from shortest hydroperiods and performed significantly better during endurance trials at 18 °C. Disentangling complex carryover effects across multiple life stages in species with high phenotypic plasticity can shed light on the physiological capacity of species to respond to changing environments and inform mechanistic predictions of persistence in the face of anthropogenic stressors.","Thompson, Cassandra M;Popescu, Viorel D",2021,"PG","LY","n ","temporary ponds","y","amphibian survival, developmental rates, and locomotor performance (results in larval survival, developmental rates, sizes at metamorphosis, terrestrial survival, size and growth, three months post-metamorphosis)","hydroperiods length (days)","y","model organism, the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), through aquatic and terrestrial mesocosm experiments","chl_14",NA
"11","contrasts between channels and backwaters in a large, floodplain river: testing our understanding of nutrient cycling, phytoplankton abundance, and suspended solids dynamics","In floodplain rivers, variability in hydraulic connectivity interacts with biogeochemistry to determine the distribution of suspended and dissolved substances. Nutrient, chlorophyll a, and suspended solids data spanning longitudinal (5 study reaches across 1300 river km), lateral (main channel and backwaters), and temporal (1994-2011) gradients in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) were used to examine the extent to which observed differences between the main channel and backwaters were consistent with expectations based on current understanding of biogeochemical processes in large rivers. For N and P, the results largely conformed to expectations. N concentrations were greater in the main channel than in the backwaters in 82 to 96% of the observations across river reaches. Maximum TP concentrations generally occurred in backwaters during summer, when backwater TP often exceeded that of the main channel. Flux of P from sediments may be a substantial source of water-column P in UMR backwaters in summer. The data for suspended solids and chlorophyll a suggest that some refinements are needed of our understanding of ecosystem processes in large rivers. During low-discharge conditions, concentrations of inorganic suspended solids often were greater in backwaters than in the main channel, suggesting the importance of sediment resuspension. Chlorophyll a concentrations were usually greater in backwaters than in the main channel, but exceptions indicate that phytoplankton abundance in the main channel of the UMR can sometimes be greater than is typically expected for large rivers.","Houser, Jeffrey N.",2016,"PG","ES","n","river-floodplain","y","Nutrient, chlorophyll a, and suspended solids","main channel and backwaters","y",NA,"chl_17",NA

"13","do environmental variables predict the trophic structure of fish fauna in a subtropical river (uruguay river ecoregion)?","Trophic interactions represent the routes through which energy flows upwards within ecosystems and the understanding of such structuring under varying environmental conditions is still challenging. Here we test the hypothesis that differences in environmental variables act as environmental filters on the composition and trophic structure of local the fish fauna of a subtropical mountain river. We predict that differences in the trophic structure of the fish fauna occur along the river continuum. Main environmental parameters have been measured and fishes were sampled quarterly between August 2013 and May 2014 at six sampling sites in the main channel of the Pelotas River, Upper Uruguay ecoregion. We collected 3848 individuals belonging to 38 species, 4 orders and 11 families. The most (82.1%) consisted of small- and medium-sized individuals. The species were classified into eight trophic guilds: aquatic insectivorous, carnivorous, detritivorous, detritivorous/aquatic insectivorous, herbivorous, iliophagous, omnivorous and piscivorous. In general, herbivorous and piscivorous guilds were the most representative in both number and biomass. Significant differences detected by Permanova were for richness, numerical abundance and biomass between all the sites sampled. Relationships between the environmental variables and the composition of trophic guilds were observed along the longitudinal gradient by RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. The abundance of guilds omnivorous, aquatic insectivorous and herbivorous increases with higher values of chlorophyll- a and vegetation cover, especially characterizing the upstream sites (S1, S2 and S3). On the other hand, the abundance of the iliophagous, detritivorous/insectivorous and piscivorous guilds increases with greater values of width, temperature, inorganic phosphorus and total solids, a fact observed in downstream sites (S4, S5 and S6). Thus, it was possible to identify a clear variation in the trophic structure of the fish fauna along the Pelotas River (upstream-downstream), in which the local variables were efficient in predicting environmental filters that influence the trophic organization. In this scenario, our study follows the longitudinal model and evidences a greater accumulation of energy in food webs in the upstream-downstream direction, which favors the greatest abundance of piscivorous, detritivorous and iliophagous verified in stretches of greater volume and dimensions of river. These results highlight the importance of the local variables and the interrelationships in the lateral connectivity processes along the river continuum.","Neves, Mayara P;Baumgartner, Dirceu;Baumgartner, Gilmar;Delariva, Rosilene L",2018,"check","DC","n","river","y","fish abundance, richness, biomass, and composition ","none","y","","chl_19",NA

"17","factors influencing algal biomass in intermittently connected, subtropical coastal ponds","Microalgae may contribute more to salt marsh productivity than realized, underscoring the importance of understanding algal dynamics in such systems. Benthic and planktonic chlorophyll-a (surrogate for total algal biomass), sediment ash-free dry weight, total suspended solids, salinity, and nutrients were examined in intermittently connected marsh ponds in the subtropical Guadalupe Estuary, Texas, USA to determine the effects of hydrologic connections on algal biomass in this system. From May 2005 to May 2006, several high water events resulting in surface water connections between ponds and nearby tidal creeks occurred, followed by disconnection and, at times, pond desiccation. During periods of disconnection, algal biomass was higher in both the benthos and the water column than during connection events when flushing occurred. Since connection events did not increase NOx, the primary source of dissolved inorganic nitrogen seemed to be nutrient cycling within the ponds. Data at the aggregated level, i.e., chlorophyll-a, indicated this system followed the flood pulse concept. During high water events, algal biomass may be exported to supplement the tidal creek food web (aquatic), whereas during low water events accumulated biomass within the ponds feed the marsh food web (terrestrial), which includes blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and the whooping crane (Grus americana).","Miller, Carrie J;Davis, Stephen E;Roelke, Daniel L;Li, Hsiu-Ping;Driffill, Matthew J",2009,"RP","CP","N","lake","Y","chla","not provided","Y","salt marsh ponds","chl_22",NA
"18","fish assemblages of tropical floodplain lagoons: exploring the role of connectivity in a dry year","Irregular rainfall and pronounced reductions of the hydrometric level in the year 2000 resulted in drastically altered hydrological connectivity of lentic environments in the upper Parana River floodplain. The objective of the present work was to examine spatial and temporal patterns of fish assemblage attributes and structure in relation to limnological variables associated with hydrological connectivity. Fish were collected quarterly by seining in the marginal areas of 15 lagoons belonging to two biotopic categories (connected and disconnected). Variation, in assemblage composition reflected the degree of hydrological connectivity. Values of assemblage attributes (species richness, density and biomass) were significantly lower in connected lagoons than in disconnected lagoons. Significantly higher values of species richness and biomass were recorded in November than in August. Rare species had the greatest effect on observed patterns in fish assemblage ordination (DCA). Observed patterns of variation in assemblage attributes were directly correlated with factors related to hydrological connectivity, such as depth, resources (zooplankton and chlorophyll a) and nutrients (total phosphorus).","Petry, Ana Cristina; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio; Gomes, Luiz Carlos",2003,"DC","LY","n","river floodplain","y","fish community composition and biomass","depth","y","chla is included in predictors, but is not the main response variable, so may not work","chl_23",NA

Thirty lakes in portions of Mississippi and Arkansas were surveyed for chlorophyll-a fluorescence and turbidity using handheld meters to determine relationships between chlorophyll-a concentrations and suspended solids. High applicability of handheld meters in the MAV presents economic benefits for monitoring the numerous lakes in the region. Additionally, twelve lakes within Bear Creek watershed, Mississippi were studied to determine how hydrologic connectivity shapes fish communities. Isolated and permanently connected floodplain lakes exhibited characteristically lacustrine and rheophilic fish communities, respectively, diversifying fishery management opportunities. Lastly, spring diel temperature and oxygen dynamics, as well as juvenile fish communities, were assessed within three habitats in a floodplain lake - pelagic environment, margin and contiguous wetlands. Variability in temperature and oxygen across the three habitats promotes spring habitat heterogeneity while supporting distinct but overlapping juvenile fish assemblages.","Steiner Andrews, Caroline Noelle",2013,"ES","MB","N","floodplain 'lakes'","Y","fish communities","habitat type","Y",NA,"chl_24",NA
"20","floods increase similarity among aquatic habitats in river-floodplain systems","During low water levels, habitats in river-floodplain systems are isolated from each other and from the main river. Oppositely, floods tend to connect water bodies with distinct hydrological characteristics and, as a result, ecological processes and biological communities tend to be more similar among the distinct habitats that comprise a river-floodplain system. Based on a literature review and also using unpublished data obtained in tropical floodplains, the aim of this paper is to highlight the effects of floods as a process that reduce spatial variability. The usual negative relationship between the coefficient of variation of any ecological indicator (e.g., chlorophyll-a or total phosphorus) and water level is the main result demonstrating a reduction in spatial variability due to floods. Considering physical, chemical or biotic data gathered in distinct habitats within the floodplain, this pattern was found in temperate and tropical regions, subjected to distinct levels of anthropogenic impacts, and at different spatial extents. The main mechanism that accounts for this pattern may be stated as follow. During low water level, the biological communities of each habitat in the floodplain (e.g. lagoons, backwater, streams) follow distinct temporal trajectories due to the effects of local driving forces (e.g. an efficient predator trapped in a lagoon but not in another). Management plans and biodiversity conservation in river floodplain systems will benefit by considering the effects of flood homogenization and increased connectivity peculiar to these unique ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","Thomaz, Sidinei M;Bini, Luis Mauricio;Bozelli, Reinaldo Luiz",2007,"DC","MB","n","river-floodplain systems","n","chlorophyll and nutrients","water level","y","Combination of literature review and analysis of unpublished data","chl_25",NA
"21","functional indicators of stream health: a river-basin approach","Summary1. The efficacy of leaf-litter decomposition, sediment respiration, biofilm biomass, growth, chlorophyll a concentration and the autotrophic index (biofilm ash-free dry mass-chlorophyll a) and fungal biomass for detecting human-induced change was evaluated using 24 references and 15 disturbed stream sites located in central Portugal.2. Decomposition rates of alder (Alnus glutinosa) and oak (Quercus robur) leaves and sediment respiration rates were effective in discriminating impairment. Decomposition was negatively correlated with abiotic factors, such as ammonium and nitrite concentrations, connectivity and alterations in the hydrological regime, and positively correlated with nitrate concentration and oxygen concentration. Sediment respiration rates were correlated with organic contamination, land use and morphological changes.3. Growth rates of biofilm, concentration of chlorophyll a and the autotrophic index, although 41-73% higher at disturbed compared to reference sites, were not significantly different. These three variables were significantly correlated with total organic carbon, oxygen concentration, pH, nitrite and the presence of dams. Fungal biomass on leaves and biofilm biomass on natural substrata did not differ between reference and disturbed sites.4. Our findings lend support to the use of functional variables like decomposition and sediment respiration in monitoring and when used together with structural variables should give a more holistic measure of stream health.","FEIO, MJ;Alves, T;BOAVIDA, M;Medeiros, A;Graca, Mas",2010,"PG","LY","n","stream","y","leaf-litter decomposition, sediment respiration, biofilm biomass, growth, chlorophyll a concentration and the autotrophic index","dams/alterations in the hydrological regime","y",NA,"chl_27",NA

"23","hydrologic variability, water chemistry, and phytoplankton biomass in a large floodplain of the sacramento river, ca, u.s.a","The Yolo Bypass, a large, managed floodplain that discharges to the headwaters of the San Francisco Estuary, was studied before, during, and after a single, month-long inundation by the Sacramento River in winter and spring 2000. The primary objective was to identify hydrologic conditions and other factors that enhance production of phytoplankton biomass in the floodplain waters. Recent reductions in phytoplankton have limited secondary production in the river and estuary, and increased phytoplankton biomass is a restoration objective for this system. Chlorophyll a was used as a measure of phytoplankton biomass in this study. Chlorophyll a concentrations were low (<4 mug l-1) during inundation by the river when flow through the floodplain was high, but concentrations rapidly increased as river inflow decreased and the floodplain drained. Therefore, hydrologic conditions in the weeks following inundation by river inflow appeared most important for producing phytoplankton biomass in the floodplain. Discharges from local streams were important sources of water to the floodplain before and after inundation by the river, and they supplied dissolved inorganic nutrients while chlorophyll a was increasing. Discharge from the floodplain was enriched in chlorophyll a relative to downstream locations in the river and estuary during the initial draining and later when local stream inflows produced brief discharge pulses. Based on the observation that phytoplankton biomass peaks during drainage events, we suggest that phytoplankton production in the floodplain and biomass transport to downstream locations would be higher in years with multiple inundation and draining sequences.","Schemel, Laurence Edward; Sommer, Ted R.; Muller-Solger, Anke B.; Harrell, William C.",2004,"DC","RP","n","floodplain and river","y","chlorophyll-a","floodplain inundation","y",NA,"chl_31",NA

Here, we measured water balance and limnological variables (water chemistry, suspended sediments, chlorophyll-a) at 20 ponds near Churchill (Manitoba) three times during the ice-free season of 2010 to explore relations among hydrological connectivity, basin morphometry, and water chemistry variations. Using principal components analysis, we identified that the ponds followed one of four distinctive ""seasonal water chemistry trajectories"" (SWCT1-4). Most of the ponds that lacked apparent hydrologic connectivity displayed SWCT1, characterized by rising alkalinity and ionic content between early June and late July due to evaporative concentration. In contrast, most ponds with apparent hydrological connectivity displayed SWCT2 or SWCT3, characterized by marked changes in suspended sediment and total nitrogen concentrations due to inflow that transferred allochthonous materials from the catchment. Ponds in SWCT2 likely possessed temporary hydrological connections during periods of relatively high water supply and exhibited marked decline of suspended sediment and total nitrogen content when hydrological connection was lost. Most ponds in SWCT3 maintained active hydrological connections during all or most of the ice-free season and possessed relatively high suspended sediment and total nitrogen concentrations throughout the season. Ponds in SWCT4 possessed relatively stable water chemistry due to greater water depth and local features that reduced wind-induced sediment resuspension.

According to their connectivity with the river, all lakes were divided into 3 categories – lakes connected with the river channel but separated from the floodplain inputs, lakes connected with the river but receiving inputs from the floodplain and totally isolated lakes. Connected lakes showed significantly higher concentrations of available nutrients and chlorophyll but the relationship between the two variables was weak in the spring and non-existent in the summer. Suspended solids were also more abundant in connected than in isolated lakes. Analyses of the proportion of chlorophyll and particulate phosphorus in suspension led us to the conclusion that water movement in connected lakes inhibited sedimentation and kept algae in the water column. Isolated oxbow lakes devoid of wind-driven mixing were more susceptible to algal sedimentation which would explain the differences observed between the two lake categories.","Kufel, Lech;Szymon Leśniczuk",2014,"DC","MB","n","lake","y","chlorophyll and nutrients","connectivity to river","y",NA,"chl_34",NA

"32","hydrological seasonality and benthic algal biomass in a neotropical floodplain river","Our study evaluated spatiotemporal variation of physicochemical parameters and benthic and sestonic algal biomass in littoral areas of the main channel and floodplain lakes of the Cinaruco River, a lowland tributary of the Orinoco River in Venezuela. The Cinaruco is characterized by a highly predictable annual flood pulse, high transparency, and extremely low conductivity and suspended sediment load. During 2002 and 2003, 10 sites in the main channel and floodplain lagoons were sampled on 12 occasions. Correspondence analysis based on water physicochemical variables and algal biomass showed that (similar to)80% of the variation in the multivariate space among sites and sampling dates was explained by 2 axes. During the high-water periods, river and lagoon sites showed high similarity in water variables and algal biomass. Conductivity, SiO 3 , and chlorophyll a concentrations (both benthic and sestonic) were low during the high-water phase. On the other hand, water variables and algal biomass differed between river and lagoon sites during the low-water period. The absence of flow in lagoons and consistently low algal biomass (sestonic and benthic) in river sites were the most important features of the spatial variability between main channel and lagoon sites during low-water phases. Benthic chlorophyll a was highly uniform at small spatial scales and significantly heterogeneous at large spatial scales. The annual flood regime of the Cinaruco, which drives the concentrations of dissolved materials and affects material interchanges between aquatic and terrestrial systems, also appears to be responsible for creating strong patterns of seasonal and spatial variation in benthic algal crops.

"35","influence of a drought event on hydrological characteristics of a small estuary on the amazon mangrove coast","The effects of atypical climatic conditions, such as those of a drought event, are remarkably accentuated in minor estuaries filled with sediments and with reduced or sporadic freshwater input, where the salinity intrusion is pronounced. To understand these effects, hydrological and hydrodynamic parameters were evaluated during a drought period in a small estuary located on the eastern Amazon coast in northern Brazil. Five campaigns were conducted between June 2012 and June 2013. Samples were collected from the surface and bottom layer every 3 h over a 25-h period at three stations of the Tapera double dagger u Estuary. To compare drought and post-drought periods, in terms of salinity and chlorophyll-a, data was recorded until June 2015. Tapera double dagger u is a relatively shallow estuary of the Amazon coastal zone, which is characterized by the absence of any direct fluvial discharge, although it does receive freshwater input from adjacent wetlands, as well as less saline waters from the Caet, Estuary through the Taici Creek. Hydrological variables were controlled by rainfall levels and the tidal range, and the water became more saline and more oxygenated, with reduced dissolved nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations when precipitation decreased. A significant variation was found between the months of June 2012 (most intense drought) and 2013 (less intense drought). The connection to the neighboring Caet, Estuary and adjacent mangroves and wetlands contributed to the influx of nutrient-enriched waters. Overall, then, it is hoped that the results of this study can contribute to the understanding of the effects of drought events in other minor estuaries on the highly indented Amazon coast, as well as in other areas of the equatorial zone with similar environmental characteristics.","Carneiro Pereira, Luci Cajueiro; Rodrigues da Costa, Adila Kelly; da Costa, Rauquirio Marinho; Magalhaes, Andre; Flores-Montes, Manuel de Jesus; Jimenez, Jose A.",2018,"ES","DC","Y","estuary","Y","salinity, chl-a","precipitation, tidal range","Y","look at full paper","chl_40",NA

"38","influence of hydrological heterogeneity on rotifer community structure in three different water bodies in shantou area, guangdong (china)","Rotifers, small but essential invertebrates in aquatic ecosystems, are sensitive to environmental changes and are proposed to be indicators of trophic state. However, the effects of hydrological heterogeneity on the rotifer community and the ability of rotifer indices to reflect trophic state across different water bodies are still unclear. Here, we investigated rotifer community structure in different seasons in the three types of water bodies: Han river downstream (HD), Reservoir (RE) and Tidal creek (TC) in Shantou City, Guangdong, China. Our findings revealed that rotifer community structure differes significantly among the three water bodies, resulting from a dominance of Keratella cochlearis, Anuraeopsis fissa and Polyarthra vulgaris, who largely accounted for the differences in water bodies. Chlorophyll-a and transparency were the main environmental drivers in RE rotifer communities, while total nitrogen, total phosphorus and salinity were the main factors in HD and TC communities. Rotifer abundance and the rotifer trophic state index decreased in the order: RE > HD > TC. However, both the Sladecek's B/T quotient and the Keratella-index decreased in the order: HD > RE > TC, which was in accordance with the Carlson's trophic index. We conclude that it is efficient to use rotifer composition in water quality assessments when comparing different water bodies. Alpha diversity of rotifers was the highest in HD, which is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Hydrological heterogeneity is the micro-factor that regulates rotifer community structures in the Shantou area.","Liang, Diwen; Wei, Nan; Wang, Qing; Jersabek, Christian D.; He, Xuejia; Yang, Yufeng",2019,"PG","LY","n","river, reservior and tidal creek","y","rotifer community structure, Chlorophyll-a, transparency, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and salinity ","location","y",NA,"chl_42",NA
"39","intra-annual variation of chlorophyll-a and nutrients in a hydraulically perturbed river-floodplain system in the grijalva river basin","Background: The lateral connectivity in the Maluco river-floodplain system was partially reduced by the highway built on a natural barrier. Goal: To determine if the concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and nutrients contrast in different water levels (WL) during a hydrologic year in the Maluco river-floodplain system. Methods: The WL, Chl-a, and nutrients (NO2-, NO3-, NH(4)(+)and TP) were simultaneously measured six times in two sites during two years. The expected differences of Chl-a and nutrients concentrations, related to the intra-annual fluctuation of the WL, were tested through multivariate techniques. The hypothesis holds that there will be no intra-annual differences of Chl-a and nutrients due to the reduction of lateral interconnection by the physical effect of the embankment. Results: No variable was discarded during PCA. The intra-annual distribution of samples was similar according to the similarity profile routine. Furthermore: 1) more than 54% of the Chl-a and TP values indicated hypereutrophic conditions throughout the year, and 2) none of the values of WL surpassed the height of the bankfull (4.5 mast). The maximum concentrations of Chl-a were registered at the minimum WL values. Conclusions: The intra-annual similarity of Chl-a and inorganic nutrients can be linked to the disconnection between the floodplain and the Grijalva river since the bankfull was not overflowed throughout the sampling time. The intra-annual trend independent at the time of persistence of the high Chl-a and TP concentrations ill the river-floodplain system opens up the opportunity to estimate the minimum input flow required to biogeochemical processes in a long-term study.","Cruz-Ramirez, Allan K.; Angel Salcedo, Miguel; Sanchez, Alberto J.; de Dios Mendoza, Juan; Barba, Everardo; Alvarez-Pliego, Nicolas; Florido, Rosa",2019,"PG","LY","n","river-floodplain","y","Chl-a, and nutrients (NO2-, NO3-, NH(4)(+)and TP) ","water level","y",NA,"chl_43",NA

It is, however, currently hindered by a lack of direct evidence on ecological impacts associated with this type of project particularly on water quality and fish communities. Here, we characterized patterns and variations of fish communities and water quality in five impounded lakes of the Chinese South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), with the aim of better understanding potential ecological impacts of inter-basin water transfers. We found that 1) the impacts of water transfer on water quality in the impounded lakes was generally characterized by hydrological parameters (e.g. total suspended solids, turbidity, transparency, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and total hardness) in an upstream-downstream direction; 2) increased hydrological connectivity may have favored biological invasion (e.g. Tridentiger bifasciatus) and promoted a potential biotic homogenization among the impounded lakes; and 3) there was a pattern of decreased fish abundance and biomass from the upstream to downstream lakes with fish communities strongly driven by changing water quality patterns across the impounded lakes. These findings improve our understanding of ecological impacts of large-scale hydraulic projects and provide a significant basis for water agencies with similar water transfer systems to optimize their water transfer management in order to minimize ecological impacts.","Guo, Chuanbo;Chen, Yushun;Gozlan, Rodolphe E;Liu, Han;Lu, Ying;Qu, Xiao;Wang, Lizhu;Xia, Wentong;Xie, Songguang;Xiong, Fangyuan",2020,"PG","CP","n","lake","y","total suspended solids, turbidity, transparency, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, total hardness, fish abundance and biomass"," inter-basin water transfers","y","connectivity metric is water transfer management, but includes response variables of interest to us","chl_49",NA
"44","periphyton response to simulated nonpoint source pollution: local over regional control","We investigated functional and structural responses of periphyton communities to simulated nonpoint source (NPS) pollution over a 2-year period. Periphyton communities were examined in three unique but hydrologically connected habitats in the lower Muskegon River: river, wetland, and lake. Our study addressed several major questions: (1) what are the effects of nonpoint source pollutants on periphyton structure and function, (2) to what degree do environmental conditions, including the pollutant delivery system and hydrologic conditions, affect periphyton response, and (3) do periphyton communities show synchronous responses to nonpoint source pollution? Nutrients were added over a 21-day period in each of the four seasons over 2 years. The effect of road salt on metabolism was evaluated in the winter and spring seasons in the river habitat only. In general, the periphyton community showed complex responses to the NPS amendments, but there was little evidence of nutrient limitation in this system based on community structure, biomass accrual, metabolism, or alkaline phosphatase activity. This result was unexpected given the relatively low ambient concentrations of phosphorus. We discuss the possibilities that nutrient delivery was ineffective or that herbivory and/or irradiance might have constrained periphyton growth, but ultimately conclude that our results suggest that periphyton communities in the lower Muskegon River watershed were (1) nutrient-replete, (2) tolerant of short-term salt additions, and (3) influenced more by local conditions (habitat) than by regional (watershed) factors. In systems where nonpoint source pollutant delivery is diffuse and hydrologic residence time is short, the influence of nonpoint source pollutants on periphyton may be either modest or too difficult to detect using traditional endpoints.","Steinman, Alan D.; Ogdahl, Mary E.; Wessell, Kelly; Biddanda, Bopi; Kendall, Scott; Nold, Stephen",2011,"RP","ES","N","all","Y","chla/salt","categorical","Y","much more about pollution and salts but may be relevant","chl_50",NA
"45","phytoplankton dynamics in the congo river","We report a dataset of phytoplankton in the Congo River, acquired along a 1700-km stretch in the mainstem during high water (HW, December 2013) and falling water (FW, June 2014). Samples for phytoplankton analysis were collected in the main river, in tributaries and one lake, and various relevant environmental variables were measured. Phytoplankton biomass and composition were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and marker pigments and by microscopy. Primary production measurements were made using the ¹³C incubation technique. In addition, data are also reported from a 19-month regular sampling (bi-monthly) at a fixed station in the mainstem of the upper Congo (at the city of Kisangani). Chl a concentrations differed between the two periods studied: in the mainstem, they varied between 0.07 and 1.77 µg L¹ in HW conditions and between 1.13 and 7.68 µg L¹ in FW conditions. The relative contribution to phytoplankton biomass from tributaries (mostly black waters) and from a few permanent lakes was low, and the main confluences resulted in phytoplankton dilution. Based on marker pigment concentration, green algae (both chlorophytes and streptophytes) dominated in the mainstem in HW, whereas diatoms dominated in FW; cryptophytes and cyanobacteria were more abundant but still relatively low in the FW period, both in the tributaries and in the main channel. Daily integrated production measured in the mainstem (n = 15) varied between 64.3 and 434.1 mg C m² day¹ in FW conditions and between 51.5 and 247.6 mg C m² day¹ in HW. Phytoplankton biomass in the Congo River mainstem was likely constrained by hydrological factors (accumulation due to increased retention time during FW, dilution by increased discharge during HW), even though increased nutrient availability in the FW period might have also stimulated phytoplankton production. In contrast to other tropical river systems where connectivity with the floodplain and the presence of natural lakes and man-made reservoirs play a prominent role in the recruitment of phytoplankton to the main river, our results show that phytoplankton growth in the Congo River can take place in the main channel, with hydrological processes allowing maintenance of phytoplankton biomass even during HW.","Descy, Jean-Pierre;Darchambeau, François;Lambert, Thibault;Stoyneva-Gaertner, Maya P;Bouillon, Steven;Borges, Alberto V",2017,"DC","CP","n","lake and river","y","chlorophyll-a","proximity to main-stem river","y",NA,"chl_51",NA

"47","rotifer abundance, biomass, and secondary production after the recovery of hydrologic connectivity between a river and two marginal lakes (sao paulo, brazil)","Rotifera density, biomass, and secondary production on two marginal lakes of Paranapanema River were compared after the recovery of hydrologic connectivity with the river (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Daily samplings were performed in limnetic zone of both lakes during the rainy season immediately after lateral inflow of water and, in the dry period, six months after hydrologic connectivity recovery. In order to identify the factors that affect rotifer population dynamics, lake water level, volume, depth, temperature, transparency, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, conductivity, suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a were determined. Variations of water physical and chemical factors that affect rotifer population were related to the lake-river degree of connection and to water level rising after drought. The water lateral inflow from the river resulted in an increase in lake water volume, depth, and transparency and a decrease in water pH, alkalinity, and suspended solids. The lake with the wider river connection, more frequent biota exchange, and larger amount of particulate and dissolved materials was richer and more diverse, while rotifer density, biomass, and productivity were lower in both periods studied. Density, biomass, and secondary production were higher in the lake with the smaller river connection and the higher physical and chemical stability. Our results show that the connectivity affects the limnological stability, associated to seasonality. Stable conditions, caused by low connectivity in dry periods, were related with high density, biomass and secondary production. Conversely, instability conditions in rainy periods were associated to elevated richness and diversity values, caused by exchange biota due to higher connectivity.","Casanova, Silvia Maria Caglierani;Panarelli, Eliana Aparecida;Henry, Raoul",2009,"ES","CP","N","lake","Y","rotifer density and biomass","water lateral inflow and river width","Y","look at full paper","chl_53",NA

"50","seasonal variations in food web dynamics of floodplain lakes with contrasting hydrological connectivity in the southern gulf of mexico","Floodplains are some of the most productive and diverse ecosystems on Earth. The Usumacinta River Basin, in the Southern Gulf of Mexico, hosts several floodplain lakes, whose integrity is threatened by water resource development. We aimed to investigate how food webs in these ecosystems vary in relation to their hydrological connectivity and seasonal flood cycles. To do this, we combined analysis of water quality and stable isotopes in two lakes with permanent connection to the Usumacinta River and two isolated lakes during dry, early rainy and late rainy season. Significant differences in chlorophyll-a, nutrients and suspended solids were reflected in distinct trophic dynamics among lakes. Stable isotope analysis revealed that fish from all lakes relied predominantly on autochthonous primary production, but while phytoplankton was the dominant resource for fish in the isolated lakes, aquatic macrophytes made the highest contribution to consumers’ production in the connected lakes. Fish tended to have broader isotopic niches during the early rainy season, likely reflecting consumption of a wider range of resources following the first flow pulses of the year.

"51","serial discontinuity along the descoberto river basin, central brazil","Aim: The Descoberto Basin was studied as a discontinuous ecological system through one seasonal cycle (about one year), at 13 sampling sites; Methods: The connectivity was analyzed in relation to environmental and limnological characteristics along the length of the Descoberto River, and the variables that most influenced the different sampling sites were determined; Results: Sites K and L, located upstream and downstream of the entrance of the Melchior River, respectively, differed most in physical and chemical parameters. A Principal Components Analysis demonstrated that the system was more influenced spatially than temporally, with 74.57% of accumulated variance accounted for by the first two axes. High values of chloride, chlorophyll-a, BOD5, total phosphorus, and total organic carbon, as well as low dissolved-oxygen concentrations separated sites L and M from the others. Winter and spring were the seasons in which most parameters showed significant differences among the sites; Conclusions: The construction of the dam and waste discharge act as discontinuity factors affecting the referred system, mainly at middle region and lower patch, between the sites K and L. Besides the construction of the reservoir, the Melchior River, an extremely impacted system, affects the Descoberto River downstream from its entry. Important changes in water quality occur in the lower basin, especially downstream of the Descoberto Reservoir, with significant increases in nutrient concentrations, suspended solids, turbidity, and chlorophyll a, and therefore a decrease in water clarity.Original Abstract: Objetivo: A bacia do rio Descoberto foi estudada como um sistema descontinuo atraves de um ciclo sazonal (um ano) em 13 estacoes amostrais; Metodos: A conectividade foi analisada em relacao a caracteristicas ambientais e limnologicas ao longo eixo longitudinal do rio Descoberto e as variaveis que mais influenciaram as diferentes estacoes amostrais foram determinadas; Resultados: As estacoes K e L, localizadas a montante e jusante da entrada do rio Melchior, respectivamente, diferiram mais quanto aos parametros fisicos e qulmicos da agua. Uma analise de componentes principals (PCA) demonstrou que o sistema foi mais influenciado espacialmente que temporalmente, com 74,57% da variancia total acumulada nos dois primeiros eixos.

A first exploration indicated that the phytoplankton community did not resist the impact of reservoirs and barely recovered downstream of them. The spatial analysis showed that the responses of the phytoplankton and environmental variables were not uniform. The two set of variables revealed spatial variability discontinuities and river fragmentation upstream and downstream from the reservoirs. Reservoirs caused the replacement of spatially heterogeneous habitats by homogeneous spatially distributed water bodies, these new environmental conditions downstream benefiting the opportunist and cosmopolitan algal taxa.

"53","short-term succession of aquatic plant species richness along ecosystem productivity and dispersal gradients in shallow lakes","Questions: The highest species richness is usually expected at an intermediate stage of development since the last major disturbance event, but some studies have shown that ecosystem productivity and dispersal may modify this pattern, suggesting the need for further studies on the effects of productivity and dispersal on the dynamics of species richness through succession. In this study, we analysed aquatic plant species richness in relation to (1) succession stage, measured as numbers of years since the last disturbance that affected the ecosystems; (2) lake productivity, measured as the chlorophyll a concentration; and (3) connectivity to similar nearby ecosystems, a proxy for the potential input of diaspores. Location: Shallow lakes of the Dombes region, France. Methods: Every 5-7 yr these shallow lakes are emptied and left to dry out for 1 yr. These drought disturbances lead to complete destruction of the submerged aquatic plant communities. Sixty lakes arranged along a gradient of productivity were selected. The probability of diaspore input was considered to increase from upstream to downstream, as lakes are organized in hydrologically connected networks via ditches, through which the downstream lakes receive water from the upstream lakes. For each lake, the aquatic plant species richness (from systematic summer vegetation sampling), time since the last disturbance (last summer drying), productivity (estimated as chlorophyll a concentration) and probability of diaspore input (assessed from position in the network) were recorded. Results: The aquatic plant species richness decreased with the time since the last disturbance for all of the lakes, but there was a significant interaction with the chlorophyll a concentration and position of the lake in the network. At the lowest ecosystem productivities, the relationship between successional stage and species richness was hump-shaped, whereas the species richness decreased with increasing time since the last disturbance when productivity increased. The lake's position in the network did not influence species richness during the first 2 yr after disturbance, but from year 3 and thereafter, lakes connected to high numbers of upstream lakes consistently exhibited decreased richness, contradicting the expected trend of increasing species richness with increasing diaspore inputs. Conclusions: This study indicates that both ecosystem productivity and connectivity strongly affected the relationship between aquatic plant species richness and succession, and that these factors should be taken into account in further developments of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.

"55","spatial connectivity in a large river system: resolving the sources and fate of dissolved organic matter","Large rivers are generally heterogeneous and productive systems that receive important inputs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial and in situ sources. Thus, they are likely to play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of the DOM flowing to the oceans. The asymmetric spatial gradient driven by directional flow and environmental heterogeneity contributes to the fate of DOM flowing downstream. Yet, the relative effects of spatial connectivity and environmental heterogeneity on DOM dynamics are poorly understood. For example, since environmental variables show spatial heterogeneity, the variation explained by environmental and spatial variables may be redundant. We used the St. Lawrence River (SLR) as a representative large river to resolve the unique influences of environmental heterogeneity and spatial connectivity on DOM dynamics. We used three-dimensional fluorescence matrices combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to characterize the DOM pool in the SLR. Seven fluorophores were modeled, of which two were identified to be of terrestrial origin and three from algal exudates. We measured a set of environmental variables that are known to drive the fate of DOM in aquatic systems. Additionally, we used asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM) modeling to take spatial connectivity into account. The combination of spatial and environmental models explained 85% of the DOM variation. We show that spatial connectivity is an important driver of DOM dynamics, as a large fraction of environmental heterogeneity was attributable to the asymmetric spatial gradient. Along the longitudinal axis, we noted a rapid increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), mostly controlled by terrestrial input of DOM originating from the tributaries. Variance partitioning demonstrated that freshly produced protein-like DOM was found to be the preferential substrate for heterotrophic bacteria undergoing rapid proliferation, while humic-like DOM was more correlated to the diffuse attenuation coefficient of UVA radiation.","Massicotte, Philippe;Frenette, Jean-Jacques",2011,"check","PG","n","river","y","dissolved organic matter (DOM), three-dimensional fluorescence matrices ","asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM) modeling","y","connectivity to downstream","chl_60",NA

"57","spatial distribution of nutrient limitation in the danube river floodplain in relation to hydrological connectivity","In this paper, we describe the influence of flooding on nutrient conditions and phytoplankton Chl-a concentrations in a hydrologically dynamic Danube floodplain in North-Eastern Croatia. Based on hydrological typology, the connectivity gradient extends from the main river stream (Eupotamal) to the backwater channels and side-arms (Parapotamal) to the edge of the floodplain (Paleopotamal). A spatial gradient of phytoplankton Chl-a occurred during low water levels, while uniformity of Chl-a across wetland habitats was observed during high water levels. Nutrient enrichment assays indicated that inorganic nutrients in Eupotamal waters (N/P ratio 16-22) could support a higher growth rate of the assay alga Chlorella kessleri, while potential N limitation was found in Parapotamal and Paleopotamal waters (both with N/P ratios< 14).

"60","spatial variability of chlorophyll-a and abiotic variables in a river-floodplain system during different hydrological phases","Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and abiotic variables were measured in the main channel and floodplain waterbodies of the Middle Parana River to analyse the system dynamics and to assess their spatial variability during different hydrological phases, including an extreme flood. We wanted to test that the flood does not always have a homogenising effect in a river-floodplain system. An explanatory model for Chl-a was performed according to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), and the relation of water level with the coefficient of variation (CV) among sites for each variable was explored. The model explained 64% of Chl-a variability. Water level, depth:euphotic zone ratio (Z (d):Z (eu)) (inverse correlation) and conductivity (direct correlation) were the significant explicative variables. The CV of Chl-a decreased with flood from the main channel to the floodplain, but for turbidity, Z (d):Z (eu), pH, dissolved oxygen, soluble reactive phosphorus and Chl-a:pheophytin-a ratio, it increased. However, within the floodplain, CV of turbidity, Z (d):Z (eu) and pH decreased during flood. These suggest that the homogenising effect frequently observed during inundation cannot be generalised and that the floodplain may maintain its identity even during flood. The extreme flood and its overlap with the warm season and sedimentological pulse probably contributed to the heterogeneity in the spatial gradient.","Mayora, Gisela; Devercelli, Melina; Giri, Federico",2013,"RP","LY","N","floodplain","Y","chla","coefficient of variation","Y",NA,"chl_63",NA
"61","spatial variability of zooplankton along a section of river sio under different habitat conditions","Many factors influence the abundance and species richness of zooplankton in river systems, including river hydrology, morphology, phytoplankton development and biotic interactions. River Sio discharges into Lake Victoria and forms a boundary between Kenya and Uganda at its middle and lower reaches. The river has an average discharge of 11.4 m3s-1 contributing 1.5% of riverine water input into Lake Victoria. Zooplankton community studies were carried out along a section of River Sio and its floodplain on the Ugandan side between November 2008 and January 2009. The main focus of the study was that River Sio zooplankton diversity; biomass and abundance patterns were expected to change with differing levels of lateral connectivity and habitat heterogeneity of the river plus its floodplain. Sampling along lateral and longitudinal transects of the river were done to investigate the effect of habitat heterogeneity subject to the river's flooding regimes on the abundance, composition and diversity of its zooplankton. Zooplankton samples were collected using a zooplankton net of mesh size 60/lm and a Schindler trap sampler for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Other factors determined were selected physico-chemical variables. Zooplankton and physical-chemical data were subjected to statistical analyses (ANOVA, multivariate, regression and correlation analyses) for significant tests after log transformation. The ordination of samples (sites and dates) of physical-chemical or biological variables was carried out using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Similarity and diversity indices were used to assess structural patterns. In total, 45 rotifer, 9 copepod and 7 cladocera species were identified. Mean zooplankton density and biomass of River Sio were lower in the main channel of the river compared to its floodplain sites. Significant habitat differences were observed for zooplankton composition and abundance but no seasonal biomass and density differences were identified. Nutrient levels of River Sio were found to be very low. Physicalchemical factors like chlorophyll-a showed strong influences on the zooplankton community structure. These findings suggest that both low and high river water levels and the availability of heterogeneous habitats are crucial for zooplankton development in River Sio. The high zooplankton density observed bears significance to the ecological functions of the river as a breeding and nursery ground for potamodromous fishes from Lake Victoria.","Gimbo, R",2009,"MB","LY","n","river and floodplain","y","zooplankton community","unclear; water level, lateral connectivity","y","Describes the impact of floodplain innundation on zooplankton.

"62","suspended sediment, nutrients, and chlorophyll in tropical floodplain lakes with different patterns of hydrological connectivity","The ecological functioning of floodplain lakes is largely influenced by the interaction with the river mainstem. In this study, seasonal variation in water chemistry and the relationship with the river conditions were compared between floodplain lakes that differ in the level of connection to the Usumacinta River, the largest river of Mesoamerica. Samples for suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll a were collected through the year in lakes permanently connected to the river and in lakes that only received water from the Usumacinta for a short period during peak flow. Floodplain lakes showed higher total suspended solids than the river during the dry season while during the rainy season greater differences were observed between the river and the lakes, probably explained by higher concentrations in the river and greater sedimentation in the lakes. Greater organic matter content in the suspended solids was observed in the floodplain lakes, particularly in the more isolated lakes, likely related to high algal biomass. Nitrate concentrations were always higher in the river than in the lakes and lower nitrate concentrations occurred at the isolated lakes, suggesting that processes that remove nitrate occur through the year and are a common feature of floodplain lakes. Phosphorus in the connected lakes was higher than in the river only during the dry season, while in the isolated lakes concentrations were always greater than in the river. Chlorophyll a concentrations were higher in the connected lakes than in the river only during the dry season, while the more isolated lakes exhibited higher values through the year, showing signs of eutrophication. Suspended organic matter, nitrate, and chlorophyll showed larger differences between lake and river sites in the more isolated lakes, probably related to greater water residence time and its influence on primary production. Less connected lakes are more vulnerable to flow alteration because the brief period of connection to the river can be compromised and the effects of eutrophication exacerbated.","Castillo, María M",2020,"DC","PG","n","lake and river","y","chlorophyll-a, nitrite, organic matter, phosporus","spatial isolation/connection","y",NA,"chl_65",NA
"63","temporal coherence between lake and landscape primary productivity","Understanding the patterns and drivers of primary productivity is a major goal of ecology, but little is known about whether the primary productivities of different types of ecosystems—here, lakes and the landscapes in which they are embedded—fluctuate in related ways through time. Due to shared climatic variation and well-known connections between lake and terrestrial ecosystems, such as nutrient and resource subsidies, we hypothesized that interannual fluctuations in aquatic and terrestrial primary productivity indices could be coherent. We also expected that lake and watershed characteristics could modify the strength and nature of primary productivity relationships. We applied wavelet coherence analyses to time series of lake chlorophyll-a and satellite-derived NDVI to examine coherence between lakes and land, and used random forest regression and generalized additive models to evaluate why coherence varies among lakes. There can be substantial coherence between lake and terrestrial primary productivity, but the strength and phase (direction and time lag) of this relationship vary widely, and there were marked differences between short (2–4-year periods of oscillation) and long (&gt; 4-year periods of oscillation) timescales. Across all timescales, variables associated with the connectedness of lakes to their watersheds were consistently the important explanatory variables of the strength and phase of coherence. The patterns observed in this study suggest the importance of cross-ecosystem flows, as opposed to shared climatic variation, in determining temporal coherence between lakes and the landscape.","Walter, Jonathan A;Fleck, Rachel;Kastens, Jude H;Pace, Michael L;Wilkinson, Grace M",2021,"DC","ES","n","lake","y","chlorophyll-a and NDVI","adjacency (somewhat unclear)","y","The connectivity metrics are not well defined, they are statistically derived from the landscapes surrounding the lakes","chl_66",NA
"64","the hydrochemical response of small and shallow floodplain water bodies to temporary surface water connections with the main river","We investigated the effects of temporary surface water connections with the main river on the water chemistry of large and small waterbodies in a Danube floodplain by comparing hydrochemical data before, during and after water exchange with the Danube during two large floods in 2009 and 2013. In addition, we studied the effects of an increased frequency of flood pulses on the water chemistry of the floodplain via long-term monitoring data. We used conservative (i.e. biologically non-reactive) parameters (alkalinity, Ca, Cl, K, Mg, Na, SO4, conductivity) to identify hydrochemical changes due to the mixing with river water. Changes in non-conservative parameters (PO4-P, NO3-N, NO2-N, NH4-N, total phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a), which deviated from pure mixing effects, were ascribed to alterations of biogeochemical processes induced by the imported river water. In large floodplain waterbodies, both conservative and non-conservative parameters changed towards Danube water concentrations during the connection with the main river and returned to pre-connection levels after the water exchange ended. Only chlorophyll-a concentrations were almost twice as high in the post-connection phase than before the connection. In small floodplain waterbodies, conservative and non-conservative parameters showed similar changes during the connection with the main river. However, the concentrations of PO4-P, total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a did not return to pre-connection levels, but increased further in the post-connection phase, exceeding even Danube water concentrations. We attribute these changes to phosphorus releases from the sediments and enhanced primary and bacterial production induced by the river water. In years with an increased flooding frequency, both conservative and non-conservative parameters approached Danube water concentrations in large floodplain waterbodies due to the increased surface water exchange. In small floodplain waterbodies, conservative parameters remained unaffected by the increased connection with the river, while nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations were considerably higher in wet years than in dry years. We conclude that the temporary input of oxygen- and nutrient-rich river water to small, mainly isolated backwaters can induce changes in benthic biogeochemical processes, which may provoke an internal eutrophication of these waterbodies.","Weigelhofer, Gabriele; Preiner, Stefan; Funk, Andrea; Bondar-Kunze, Elisabeth; Hein, Thomas",2015,"ES","PG","N","riverine","Y","multiple ","Chl-a, nuts","Y",NA,"chl_68",NA
"65","the impact of inundation-isolation cycles on the culturable bacterioplankton in the danube river floodplain","The investigation was conducted in the Kopacki Rit Nature Park (eastern Croatia) which is established to protect the floodplain area of the Danube River. The samples were collected monthly in four sites (channels and lakes) with increasing distance from the river. The aim of investigation was to examine trophic structure of culturable bacterioplankton in relation to inundation-isolation cycles on sampling sites with unequal degree of connection with the Danube river. A change in the ratio of copiotrophs (r- strategists) to oligotrophs (K-strategists) was expected as the different organic carbon sources emerged. The composition of variables was revealed by Principal Component Analysis of abiotic water properties (temperature, water depth, transparency, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nutrient concentrations) and the chlorophyll-a concentration. Scores of significant components were used in a Multiple Regression as independent variables and the relationship between the scores and abundance of colony forming units (CFUs) was examined. Regression model was significant only for copiotrophs, and their relative dominance was noticed in couple of samples on more isolated sampling sites. In all other samples oligotrophs were a dominant group, especially during the flood pulses or drainage after it. Their elevated abundance was equally distributed in all groups revealed by Principal Component Analysis, and corresponds to the fluvial action. Also concerning the two-way ANOVA (sites/samplings) oligotrophs are highly influenced by the sampling period i.e. inundation-isolation cycles. They are probably driven by the allochthonous organic matter provided by floods or have allochthonous origin itself. At the same time, copiotrophs are to some extent coupled with the established water properties, i.e. bottom-up controlled and their abundance is influenced by the localisation of sampling sites in the floodplain. These results describe the development of the conditions that promote habitat specific succession of the culturable bacterioplankton. Established differences had disappeared after additional inundation-isolation cycles.","Palijan, Goran; Bogut, Irella; Vidakovic, Jasna",2008,"ES","CP","N","riverine","Y","trophic structure of bacterioplankton","scores of abiotic WQ + Chl-a components (PCA)","y","look at full paper","chl_69",NA
"66","the performance of ecological cage aquaculture of pejerrey odontesthes bonariensis in pampean lakes under two different hydrological scenarios","Ecological aquaculture promotes the development of sustainable farming systems, focusing on a wide range of ecosystem elements. The ecological aquaculture of the zooplanktivorous pejerrey ( Odontesthes bonariensis ) in floating cages in Pampean shallow lakes (Argentina) needs to be carried out considering the hydrological and chemical variations as modulators of plankton community and consequently of the pejerrey yield. To assess its performance in lakes with contrasting hydrological regimes, an experiment was carried out in two water bodies: La Salada de Monasterio Lake (Mon), an endorheic environment, and San Lorenzo Lake (Lor), connected to several lakes and the Salado River. During the experiment, regional rainfall generated high hydrological variability in Lor Lake changing its status of unconnected lake to a runâ€ofâ€theâ€river lake. High standard deviation in Chlorophyllâ€a values in Lor indicated the significant effects of hydrological instability on the plankton community. Microcrustaceans abundance and biomass were higher in Mon, and almost disappeared in Lor when it turns into runâ€ofâ€theâ€river. The final fish growth and survival were significantly higher in Mon, endorsing the importance of zooplankton of high nutritional quality and hydrological, physicalâ€“chemical and biological stability. The results indicate that productive and stable environments with a sustained offer of natural food are better for the zooplanktivorous fish production. Connectivity with other water bodies and hydrological dependence on rainfall regimes have defining effects on phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish production, thus emerging as key factors to be considered for achieving better results in the ecological aquaculture implementation.","Javier R Garcia de Souza;Moreno, Vivian Yorojo;Sathicq, MarÃ­a B;GÃ³mez, Nora;Sampietro, Susana;Donadelli, Jorge;Colautti, DarÃ­o C",2021,"MB","RP","n","lake","y","chlorophyll a, microcrustacean abundance and biomass, fish growth and survival","connected/not connected","y","Included because paper describes the impact of changes in hydrologic connectivity on phytoplankton and the food web (zooplankton, fish).","chl_71",NA

"69","towards deconfounding hydrological and seasonal temperature variability in the determination of selected limnological variables of a temperate floodplain ecosystem","This paper presents a methodological approach that can aid the assessment of variation in limnological variables in response to hydrological phases and seasonal temperature variation. The investigation was conducted in the Danube River floodplain, Kopacki Rit, Croatia. The proposed approach facilitates a more accurate examination of the effects of first factor, while maintaining second factor less variable, and vice versa. Samples were collected in the floodplain channel and lake along a temporal connectivity gradient, and were grouped according to three hydrological phases (isolation, flow pulse and flood pulse) and according to three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). A permutational multivariate analysis of variance was used to analyse the hydrological effects within seasons, as well as seasonal effects within hydrological phases on selected limnological variables: pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nitrites, nitrates, ammonium, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a concentrations and ratio of copiotrophic to oligotrophic bacteria. A multivariate data cloud was structured by hydrological phases during all investigated seasons, but not by all seasons during different hydrological phases. The strongest impact of hydrological phases on limnological variables occurred during summer. Seasonal effects were significant during the isolation and the flood pulse phases. The flow pulse phase somehow obscured the effects of seasonal change, resulting in temporal floodplain homogenization. One possible explanation is that water temperature determines potential limnological conditions, whereas hydrology determines actual conditions. Such results must be taken into account if the accurate effects of hydrology and seasonal change are to be assessed in temperate floodplain ecosystems.

In this chapter, we have assessed the influence of hydrological connectivity with the main channel on the trophic state and water quality in the Lake Sakadas. The evaluation of trophic state combines a number of physical, chemical and biological parameters with the objective to select the relevant indicators for the floodplain lakes. The following environmental parameters have been considered: water temperature, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, water transparency, chlorophyll-a concentration, phytoplankton primary productivity, benthic and periphytic communities and laboratory experiments (nutrient enrichment bioassay). An integrative approach, which includes in situ research and laboratory experiments, indicated strong correlations of abiotic and biotic components with a hydrological regime.

In this chapter, we have assessed the influence of hydrological connectivity with the main channel on the trophic state and water quality in the Lake Sakadas. The evaluation of trophic state combines a number of physical, chemical and biological parameters with the objective to select the relevant indicators for the floodplain lakes. The following environmental parameters have been considered: water temperature, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, water transparency, chlorophyll-a concentration, phytoplankton primary productivity, benthic and periphytic communities and laboratory experiments (nutrient enrichment bioassay). An integrative approach, which includes in situ research and laboratory experiments, indicated strong correlations of abiotic and biotic components with a hydrological regime.

"72","using stressor-response models to derive numeric nutrient criteria for lakes in the eastern plain ecoregion, china","Lakes in the Eastern Plain ecoregion of China are typically shallow, experience large disturbances, and are hydrologically connected to rivers. In recent years, lake eutrophication in this ecoregion has intensified due to human activities. To determine important regional nutrient criteria, the effects of hydrologic features and disturbances should be taken into account. In this paper, annual average data were used to construct stressor-response models for each hydrological lake type identified for lakes in the Eastern Plain ecoregion. In these models, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) criteria were obtained from a chlorophyll a (Chl-a, response variable) threshold value. A Chl-a concentration of 4.73 mu gL super(-1) was identified as this threshold value, which was based on the cyanotoxin limits associated with drinking water supply. The three lake types, which differed in hydrological structure, had significantly different TN and TP criteria. For example, lakes connected to the Yangtze River (T sub(1)) had a TN criterion ranging from 0.594 to 0.838mgL super(-1), which was substantially higher than those for lakes that were never connected to the river (T sub(3), 0.234-0.422mgL super(-1)). The exception to this trend occurred for lakes that were historically but not currently connected to the river (T sub(2)) due to P-limitation in this lake type. However, there was little variability in the TP criterion among T sub(1), T sub(2), and T sub(3) lakes, the values of which ranged from 0.021 to 0.037, 0.023 to 0.042, and 0.028 to 0.041mgL super(-1), respectively. This study hypothesized that the hydrological connectivity between lakes and rivers could regulate the relationships between stressors and their biological responses in lakes in the Eastern Plain ecoregion, leading to variability in appropriate nutrient criteria for different lake types. Setting nutrient criteria for the entire ecoregion and for different lake types by using stressor-response models will make the criteria values more credible and defensible.","Zhang, Yali;Huo, Shouliang;Ma, Chunzi;Xi, Beidou;Li, Xiang;Liu, Hongliang",2014,"check","PG","n","lakes connected to a river",NA,"total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a","connected, historically connected or never connected","y",NA,"chl_78",NA

"76","an abiotic typology and reference conditions for nutrients and chlorophyll-a in subtropical reservoirs (são paulo state, brazil)","The establishment of reference conditions and typology are two important steps in water resources management. The reference conditions enable the determination of how impacted an ecosystem is, while the typology facilitates the implementation of management procedures. A study of subtropical reservoirs in São Paulo State (Brazil) was performed to obtain (1) an abiotic typology, using principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (Ward's method with Euclidean distances), and (2) reference conditions for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the dry and rainy seasons for one of the established typologies. Two main statistical techniques were used: the lake population distribution approach and the trisection method. PCA identified an environmental gradient in the east-west direction, with reservoirs at higher latitudes and with larger dimensions in the west, and smaller reservoirs in eastern areas with higher altitude and higher average annual rainfall. The PCA and cluster analysis indicated that there were four main types of reservoirs. The nutrient criteria techniques, obtained for 13 type I rainy-east reservoirs, were not significantly different (t test, p &lt; 0.05). Although the methods resulted in similar reference conditions, one-way ANOVA indicated significant differences between the seasons for Chl-a, which levels were slightly higher in the rainy season. As far as we know, this is the first study to simultaneously provide an abiotic typology and reference conditions for chlorophyll-a and nutrients in different seasons, considering subtropical reservoirs in South America. This investigation makes an important contribution to the monitoring and management of subtropical reservoirs, and the promotion of dialog between the scientific community and managers, aiming at ensuring the sustainability of water bodies.","Cardoso-Silva, Sheila;Frascareli, Daniele;Silva, Daniel C V R;Figueira, Rubens César Lopes;Bittencourt, Marisa Dantas;Moschini-Carlos, Viviane;Pompêo, Marcelo",2021,"ES","RP","N","reservoir","Y","Chl-a, Total N, Total P","abiotic typology, reference conditions ","N",NA,"chl_5","connectivity"

Yet, the effects of LHC alteration on aquatic ecosystems have not been rigorously tested and synthesized. Here, we conducted a literature review and meta-analysis to provide a global synthesis of the effects of LHC alteration on aquatic ecosystems, and to test the effectiveness of indicators for bioassessment. In our review we found that the effects of LHC alteration were disproportionally documented in terms of geographic distribution and research subject. Most studies were conducted in Europe and America on the biodiversity and abundance of macroinvertebrates and fish. In our meta-analysis, we compared effect sizes between pairs of three LHC levels, i.e. disconnected, moderately connected, and highly connected. We found that only a limited number of water quality indicators (e.g. chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen) and biological community indicators (e.g. fish species richness, and zooplankton abundance) showed significant differences between LHC levels. The responses of these indicators to LHC alteration differed, and sometimes in opposing directions. We found out responsive indicators and their response trends, which could not only facilitate effective biomonitoring and bioassessment with regard to engineering and restoration of LHC, but also provide scientific underpinnings of the understanding of trade-offs among the indicators. We identified knowledge gaps and provided recommendations on how to fill these gaps, which included investigating rarely documented regions, developing new indicators, and quantifying mechanistic links between LHC and ecosystem functioning and services.","Shen, Minghua;Liu, Xueqin",2021,"check","ES","?","multiple","N","WQ+biological community indicators","effect sizes of connectivity","Y",NA,"chl_7",NA

We hypothesized that phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass respond to hydrologic cycles, peaking during the wet season, and that microcystin (MC) concentrations are highest following the bloom collapse. Hydrologic loading (inferred from rainfall and lake level changes) and phytoplankton responses in two basins of the lake were monitored over a wet season followed by a dry season between September 2010 and March 2011. Results show that both phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass peaked in both basins during the wet season, with associated peaks in particulate MC concentrations. Even though phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass were higher in the smaller deep basin, MC concentrations were lower than in the large shallow basin. The high-MC levels during the wet season were followed by a greater MC production per cyanobacteria biomass unit in the dry season in both basins. The timing of the cyanobacteria bloom suggests that its formation was likely controlled by large nutrient influxes from the contributing catchment to the lake associated with intense rainfall following an intense drought, posing a risk to the health of the community due to increased MC levels.","Raffoul, M.

"80","benthic algal response to hyporheic-surface water exchange in an alluvial river","We studied the response of benthic algae to points of hyporheic-surface water exchange in the main channel of the Middle Fork Flathead River within the Nyack Flood Plain, Montana. We examined hyporheic exchange at 120 sites using piezometers and measuring vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG), hydraulic conductivity, and vertical discharge. We removed benthic algae from a single cobble at each site, and we used VHG to group sampling sites for statistical analysis. Algal cell density and chlorophyll a concentration were significantly higher at sites with hyporheic discharge (+VHG, upwelling) compared to both sites with hyporheic recharge (-VHG, downwelling) and sites with no hyporheic-surface water exchange (=VHG, neutral) (ANOVA, P < 0.05). The assemblages of algae at upwelling sites were also significantly different from downwelling and neutral exchange sites (ANOSIM, P < 0.05). Filamentous green algae Stigeoclonium sp. and Zygnema sp. and a chrysophyte, Hydrurus foetidus (Villars) Trevisan were abundant at upwelling sites, whereas an assemblage of diatoms Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kutzing) Czarnecki, Cymbella excisa Kutzing, Diatoma moniliformis Kutzing, and Gomphonema olivaceoides Hustedt, were the most abundant taxa at downwelling and neutral exchange sites, occurring attached to, or in close association with the stalks of Didymosphenia geminata (Lyngbye) Schmidt. These data show that benthic algal communities are structured differently depending on the direction of hyporheic flux in the main channel of a large alluvial river, suggesting that hyporheic-surface exchange may influence the spatial distribution of main-channel benthic algae in rivers with hyporheic-surface water connectivity.","Wyatt, Kevin H.; Hauer, F.

However, little is known about the contribution of marginal permanent and temporary riverine aquatic systems to river carbon metabolism. Elevation, in relation to flooding, hydro-morphological, and ecological features of such habitats, can affect the gas fluxes across the water-atmosphere interfaces and the periodically air-exposed riverbeds. This hypothesis was investigated in the lowland sector of the Po River (Northern Italy) from May to September 2008. Five different aquatic habitats were considered: the main river course; a backwater habitat; and three lateral lentic waterbodies-an oxbow and two quarry lakes of different age. The water mass was always CO2 and CH4 supersaturated, and gas fluxes were from the water to the atmosphere. In the highly dynamic river course and backwaters, CO2 emission rates were nearly one order of magnitude greater than in the lentic and hypoxic oxbow and quarry lakes. By contrast, CH4 fluxes peaked in the lentic, deeper, and permanent water bodies. At sediment-atmosphere interfaces, the CO2 emissions increased along an organic matter, a water saturation, and a chlorophyll a gradient, attaining the maximum rates in the periodically air-exposed riverbed and marginal sandy sediments. These differences in gas fluxes resulted from either the submersion persistence or the alternation of submersion and emersion phases, which were ultimately due to the gap between elevation and river water variations.

"86","granal stacking of thylakoid membranes in higher plant chloroplasts: the physicochemical forces at work and the functional consequences that ensue","The formation of grana in chloroplasts of higher plants is examined in terms of the subtle interplay of physicochemical forces of attraction and repulsion. The attractive forces between two adjacent membranes comprise (1) van der Waals attraction that depends on the abundance and type of atoms in each membrane, on the distance between the membranes and on the dielectric constant, (2) depletion attraction that generates local order by granal stacking at the expense of greater disorder (i.e. entropy) in the stroma, and (3) an electrostatic attraction of opposite charges located on adjacent membranes. The repulsive forces comprise (1) electrostatic repulsion due to the net negative charge on the outer surface of thylakoid membranes, (2) hydration repulsion that operates at small separations between thylakoid membranes due to layers of bound water molecules, and (3) steric hindrance due to bulky protrusions of Photosystem I (PSI) and ATP synthase into the stroma. In addition, specific interactions may occur, but they await experimental demonstration. Although grana are not essential for photosynthesis, they are ubiquitous in higher plants. Grana may have been selected during evolution for the functional advantages that they confer on higher plants. The functional consequences of grana stacking include (1) enhancement of light capture through a vastly increased area-to-volume ratio and connectivity of several PSIIs with large functional antenna size, (2) the ability to control the lateral separation of PSI from PSII and, therefore, the balanced distribution of excitation energy between two photosystems working in series, (3) the reversible fine-tuning of energy distribution between the photosystems by State 1-State 2 transitions, (4) the ability to regulate light-harvesting via controlled thermal dissipation of excess excitation energy, detected as non-photochemical quenching, (5) dynamic flexibility in the light reactions mediated by a granal structure in response to regulation by a trans-thylakoid pH gradient, (6) delaying the premature degradation of D1 and D2 reaction-centre protein(s) in PSII by harbouring photoinactived PSIIs in appressed granal domains, (7) enhancement of the rate of non-cyclic synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as well as the regulation of non-cyclic vs. cyclic ATP synthesis, and (8) the potential increase of photosynthetic capacity for a given composition of chloroplast constituents in full sunlight, concomitantly with enhancement of photochemical efficiency in canopy shade. Hence chloroplast ultrastructure and function are intimately intertwined.","Chow, Wah Soon; Kim, Eun-Ha; Horton, Peter; Anderson, Jan M.",2005,"MB","PG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"n","Not relevant, about chloroplasts","chl_28","connectivity"

It is not currently known what the dominant controls on this variation are at regional scales and over longer time periods. The aim of this thesis is to characterize the natural variation in trophic status, as measured by the concentration of chlorophyll a (CHLa), and assess the importance of hydrology, captured by climatic and landscape metrics, in explaining the spatial and temporal variation in trophic status. Indicators of trophic status were derived from Landsat images acquired during late summer (August) over a 20 year period from 1984 to 2003. A two-way analysis of variance revealed that of the total variation in CHLa, approximately 50 percent was in the spatial component, 10 percent was in the temporal component and 40 percent was in the spatio-temporal component, which also included the error term. Variation in the temporal component was related non-linearly to climate, as measured by effective precipitation (precipitation minus evapotranspiration). The relation between CHLa and climate indicated that under wet conditions CHLa decreased possibly due to phosphorus dilution and that under dry conditions CHLa increased possibly due to phosphorus concentration. Variation in the spatial component was related to indicators of groundwater and surface water connectivity. Lakes, situated in regional groundwater flow systems, exhibited higher CHLa than lakes situated in local groundwater flow systems. For the majority of lakes, situated in local groundwater flow systems, high wetland cover in their catchments corresponded to low CHLa whereas low wetland cover corresponded to high CHLa. For the minority of lakes, located in regional groundwater flow systems, higher stream connectivity was associated with higher CHLa. Overall, groundwater and surface water variables explained 74 percent of the spatial variation and climatic variables explained 78 percent of the temporal variation. These results underscore the importance of considering hydrology when understanding the sources of variation in trophic status measured at regional scales over long time periods.

"90","immigration and early life stages recruitment of the european flounder (platichthys flesus) to an estuarine nursery: the influence of environmental factors","Connectivity between coastal spawning grounds and estuarine nurseries is a critical step in the life cycle of many fish species. Larval immigration and transport-associated physical–biological processes are determinants of recruitment success to nursery areas. The recruitment of the European flounder, Platichthys flesus, to estuarine nurseries located at the southern edge of the species distribution range, has been usually investigated during its juvenile stages, while estuarine recruitment during the earlier planktonic life stage remains largely unstudied. The present study investigated the patterns of flounder larval recruitment and the influence of environmental factors on the immigration of the early life stages to the Lima estuary (NW Portugal), integrating data on fish larvae and post-settlement individuals (&lt;50mm length), collected over 7years. Late-stage larvae arrived at the estuary between February and July and peak abundances were observed in April. Post-settlement individuals (&lt;50mm) occurred later between April and October, whereas newly-settled ones (&lt;20mm) were found only in May and June. Variables associated with the spawning, survival and growth of larvae in the ocean (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a and inland hydrological variables) were the major drivers of flounder occurrence in the estuarine nursery. Although the adjacent coastal area is characterized by a current system with strong seasonality and mesoscale variability, we did not identify any influence of variables related with physical processes (currents and upwelling) on the occurrence of early life stages in the estuary. A wider knowledge on the influence of the coastal circulation variability and its associated effects upon ocean-estuarine connectivity is required to improve our understanding of the population dynamics of marine spawning fish that use estuarine nurseries.","Amorim, Eva;Bordalo, Adriano A;Elliott, Michael;Ramos, Sandra",2016,"PG","ES","n","estuary","y","fish larvae and post-settlement spawning, survival and growth, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a and ""inland hydrological variables""","unknown","n","coastal circulation variability was referenced as a source of connectivity","chl_39","marine"

"92","land-sea connectivity, ecohydrology and holistic management of the great barrier reef and its catchments: time for a change","The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is an iconic and highly valued ecosystem in Queensland, Australia that is recognised internationally for its natural and cultural values. The coastal and marine ecosystems of the GBR are interconnected with the adjacent catchment area through hydrological connections. However, many GBR ecosystems are in a poor state, driven by several factors including a highly modified catchment. Land use changes over the last 160 years have led to development of agricultural land uses, modification of the coastal floodplains and loss of freshwater wetlands, and disruption of drainage and hydrological connections. These ecohydrological changes have led to declining water quality in catchment waterways and increases in the loads of pollutants that are delivered to the GBR, which predominantly occurs in wet season rainfall events. The Australian and State governments have recognised the need to address water quality issues for the GBR through management of the catchments, however, the management strategies adopted to date are largely associated with improvement of agricultural management practices and are not likely to be enough to maintain or restore the health of the GBR ecosystems. Future management strategies need to take into the account the need to protect, maintain and restore coastal ecosystems, system functions and land-sea connectivity if the values of the GBR are to be retained in the long term.

Protein phosphorylation resulted in an increase in the 77.degree. K fluorescence signal at 735 nm relative to that at 685 nm. In addition, a decrease in connectivity between Photosystem II centers (PS II) and a dynamic quenching of the room temperature variable fluorescence was observed upon phosphorylation. Accompanying these fluorescence changes was a 23% decrease in the amount of stacked membranes. Microscopic analyses indicated that 8.0-nm particles fracturing on the P-face moved from the stacked into the unstacked regions upon phosphorylation. The movement of the 8.0-nm particles was accompanied by the appearance of chlorophyll b and 25 to 29 kD [kiloDalton] polypeptides in isolated stroma lamellae fractions. Phosphorylation of a population of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein complexes (LHC) in grana partitions causes the migration of these pigment proteins from the PS II-rich appressed membranes into the Photosystem I (PS I) enriched unstacked regions. This increases the absorptive cross section of PS I. In addition, we suggest that the mobile population of LHC functions to interconnect PS II centers in grana partitions; removal of this population of LHC upon phosphorylation limits PS II .fwdarw.

"97","terrestrialization alters organic matter dynamics and habitat quality for freshwater mussels (unionoida) in floodplain backwaters","Anthropogenically induced reduction in flood inundation frequency often leads to terrestrialisation, which accompanies establishment and expansions of tree cover on areas formerly with little or no trees. We tested hypotheses that terrestrialisation degrades habitat for freshwater mussels (Unionoida: Unio douglasiae nipponensis and Lanceolaria grayana) by changing the organic matter (OM) dynamics in floodplain backwaters.Stable isotope composition of seston, periphyton, fine and coarse benthic particulate OM (FBPOM and CBPOM) and mussel tissues was measured to understand OM dynamics and food webs in 14 backwaters in the middle segment of the Kiso River, Japan. Isotope ratios, C:N ratio and chlorophyll a as a proxy of food resource characteristics and the frequency of hypoxia were related to mussel growth rates.delta C-13 of seston, periphyton and FBPOM was low at sites with lower inundation frequency (a greater degree of terrestrialisation), whereas such a trend was not observed for CBPOM (i.e. riparian leaf litter). Mussels fed exclusively on seston or mixtures of seston and periphyton with their delta C-13 tracking fluctuations in food resources.Sestonic delta C-13 differences were attributed to changes in dominant carbon origin from predominantly river-borne to autochthonous sources, while periphytic delta C-13 differences were possibly caused by a varying level of dependence on respiratory CO2. FBPOM-delta C-13 differences were associated with a greater contribution of CBPOM to the FBPOM pool in infrequently flooded backwaters. Variability in mussel growth was more closely related to hypoxia than food resource characteristics.We inferred that terrestrialisation changes quality of seston and benthic detritus and degrades habitat conditions largely by accumulating riparian leaf litter in the benthic detrital pool and increasing the frequency of hypoxia. The removal of riparian trees may temporarily improve habitat condition in backwaters heavily affected by terrestrialisation. However, ecological integrity in the long run requires the recovery of the process that suppresses terrestrialisation, which includes restoration of incised channels and flood pulses.","Negishi, Junjiro N.; Katsuki, Kotaro; Kume, Manabu; Nagayama, Shigeya; Kayaba, Yuichi",2014,"ES","CP","Y","riverine","Y","mussel growth rate","inundation frequency","N","C:N ratio, isotopic composition, and Chl-a related to mussel growth","chl_67","marine"

"99","the lake-catchment (lakecat) dataset: characterizing landscape features for lake basins within the conterminous usa","Natural and human-related landscape features influence the ecology and water quality of lakes. Summarizing these features in a hydrologically meaningful way is critical to understanding and managing lake ecosystems. Such summaries are often done by delineating watershed boundaries of individual lakes. However, many technical challenges are associated with delineating hundreds or thousands of lake watersheds at broad spatial extents. These challenges can limit the application of analyses and models to new, unsampled locations. We present the Lake-Catchment (LakeCat) Dataset (https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/lakecat) of watershed features for 378,088 lakes within the conterminous USA. We describe the methods we used to: 1) delineate lake catchments, 2) hydrologically connect nested lake catchments, and 3) generate several hundred watershed-level metrics that summarize both natural (e.g., soils, geology, climate, and land cover) and anthropogenic (e.g., urbanization, agriculture, and mines) features. We illustrate how this data set can be used with a random forest model to predict the probability of lake eutrophication by combining LakeCat with data from US Environmental Protection Agency's National Lakes Assessment (NLA). This model correctly predicted the trophic state of 72% of NLA lakes, and we applied the model to predict the probability of eutrophication at 297,071 unsampled lakes across the conterminous USA. The large suite of LakeCat metrics could be used to improve analyses of lakes at broad spatial extents, improve the applicability of analyses to unsampled lakes, and ultimately improve the management of these important ecosystems.","Hill, Ryan A.; Weber, Marc H.; Debbout, Rick M.; Leibowitz, Scott G.; Olsen, Anthony R.",2018,"MB","CP","n","lakes","y","prabability of lake eutrophication","none","y","Unclear relevance; about characterizing lake cachments ","chl_70",NA

"101","transversal and lateral exciton energy transfer in grana thylakoids of spinach","The excitation energy transfer between photosystem (PS) II complexes was studied in isolated grana disks and thylakoids using chlorophyll a fluorescence induction measurements in the presence of DCMU under stacked and destacked conditions. Destacking of grana was achieved using a sonication protocol in a buffer without MgCl 2 . The degree of stacking was controlled and quantified by atomic force microscopy and by the concomitant absorption changes. As expected from the literature, intact thylakoids showed a strong dependency of the connectivity of PSII centers, the F m /F o ratio as well as the fraction of PSII(beta) centers on the MgCl 2 concentration. In contrast, these parameters did not change in isolated grana disks. In particular, the connectivity remained constantly high irrespective of the degree of destacking. These differences were explained by the high protein density in grana disks, which hinders separation and mixing of proteins sufficiently to change energy transfer properties. Due to the occurrence of stroma lamella in intact thylakoids, intermixing of PSII and PSI is possible and allows for changes in F m /F o ratio as is the separation of LHCII from PSII, thus leading to an increase in the fraction of PSII(beta). Even if mixing and separation of proteins are impaired in isolated grana disks, destacking should lead to a decrease in connectivity if transversal excitation energy transfer between two opposite membranes is significant. Because the connectivity is constant over all degrees of destacking employed, we conclude that the energy transfer in granas is mainly lateral.","Kirchhoff, H;Borinski, M;Lenhert, S;Chi, L;Büchel, C",2004,"RP","DC",NA,NA,"Y",NA,NA,"N","all about spinach","chl_76","connectivity"
"102","algal extracellular release in river-floodplain dissolved organic matter: response of extracellular enzymatic activity during a post-flood period","River-floodplain systems are susceptible to rapid hydrological events. Changing hydrological connectivity of the floodplain generates a broad range of conditions, from lentic to lotic. This creates a mixture of allochthonously and autochthonously derived dissolved organic matter (DOM). Autochthonous DOM, including photosynthetic extracellular release (PER), is an important source supporting bacterial secondary production (BSP). Nonetheless, no details are available regarding microbial extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA) as a response to PER under variable hydrological settings in river-floodplain systems. To investigate the relationship between bacterial and phytoplankton components, we therefore used EEA as a tool to track the microbial response to non-chromophoric, but reactive and ecologically important DOM. The study was conducted in three floodplain subsystems with distinct hydrological regimes (Danube Floodplain National Park, Austria). The focus was on the post-flood period. Enhanced %PER (up to 48% of primary production) in a hydrologically isolated subsystem was strongly correlated with beta-glucosidase, which was related to BSP. This shows that in disconnected floodplain backwaters with high terrestrial input BSP can also be driven by autochthonous carbon sources (PER). In a semi-isolated section, in the presence of fresh labile material from primary producers, enhanced activity of phenol oxidase was observed. In frequently flooded river-floodplain systems, BSP was mainly driven by enzymatic degradation of particulate primary production. Our research demonstrates that EEA measurements are an excellent tool to describe the coupling between bacteria and phytoplankton, which cannot be deciphered when focusing solely on chromophoric DOM.","Sieczko, Anna; Maschek, Maria; Peduzzi, Peter",2015,"DC","LY","n","floodplain","y","microbial extracellular enzymatic activity","disconnected backwaters vs. connected areas","n","focus appears to be microbial","pro_4",NA
"103","consistent trophic patterns among fishes in lagoon and channel habitats of a tropical floodplain river: evidence from stable isotopes","The relationship between food web dynamics and hydrological connectivity in rivers should be strongly influenced by annual flood pulses that affect primary production dynamics and movement of organic matter and consumer taxa. We sampled basal production sources and fishes from connected lagoons and the main channel of a low-gradient, floodplain river within the Orinoco River Basin in Venezuela. Stable isotope analysis was used to model the contribution of four basal production sources to fishes, and to examine patterns of mean trophic position during the falling-water period of the annual flood cycle. IsoSource, a multi-source mixing model, indicated that proportional contributions from production sources to fish assemblages were similar in lagoons and the main channel. Although distributions differed, the means for trophic positions of fish assemblages as well as individual species were similar between the two habitats. These findings contradict recent food web studies conducted in temperate floodplain rivers that described significant differences in trophic positions of fishes from slackwater and floodplain versus main channel habitats. Low between-habitat trophic variation in this tropical river probably results from an extended annual flood pulse (ca. 5 mo.) that allows mixing of sestonic and allochthonous basal production sources and extensive lateral movements of fishes throughout the riverscape.","Roach, KA;Winemiller, KO;Layman, CA;Zeug, S C",2009,"DC","ES","n","river and lagoon","y","isotope ","connected lagoons vs. main channel","y","unclear whether it will be possible to dervice clear response variable from isotope results, but worth trying","pro_11",NA

Record flooding of the Illinois River, Illinois, in 2013 reconnected two floodplain preserves under restoration that had been disconnected from the river by levees for &gt;80 years. Differences in hydrological connections between sites created a natural experiment where field-based data collection could be employed to document flood effects. Levee failure and subsequent river connection at Merwin Preserve increased nutrient capture and floodwater retention, shifted microbial and invertebrate communities, increased fish species richness, spawning and nursery habitat, and stimulated production of moist-soil plant communities during summer drawdown that provided foraging habitat for spring-migrating waterfowl. However, increased hydrologic connectivity during the growing season resulted in loss of submersed vegetation and habitat for autumn-migrating waterfowl. In contrast, river water overtopped the levee at Emiquon Preserve during a 6-day event that resulted in marginal changes in the bacterial community and negligible changes in water quality and community diversity. Tradeoffs among ecological services should be carefully considered when reconnection of highly altered rivers to restored lakes and wetlands is proposed.","Lemke, Michael J;Hagy, Heath M;Dungey, Keenan;Casper, Andrew F;Lemke, A Maria;VanMiddlesworth, T D;Kent, Angela",2017,"DC","PG","n","river and floodplain","y","biotic communities and water quality","degree and duration of floodplain connection (high vs. low)","y","unclear whether chla is included, but higher trophic levels are present","pro_18",NA

Sources of primary production supporting metazoan biomass might best be understood by using a pluralistic approach that views basal sources as a dependent variable and key physicochemical and hydrological factors as independent variables. Here, I review studies in which chemical markers (stable-isotope and fatty-acid analyses) were used to estimate dominant primary producers contributing to consumer biomass in large rivers and evaluate associated independent variables (e.g., hydrologic regime, turbidity, concentration of dissolved organic matter, floodplain vegetation, lateral connectivity, and upstream impoundment) that have been hypothesized to contribute to variation in basal production sources. My review shows that C₄ grasses rarely support riverine metazoans and that algae are the predominant source of C supporting upper trophic levels of large rivers worldwide. However, I also found that many consumers assimilate material from C(3) plants in rivers with high sediment loads and low transparency during high-flow pulses. Exceptions to this pattern occur when river reaches are downstream from an impoundment, in which case, algae assume greater importance. Terrestrial C(3) plants also subsidize consumers in rivers with high dissolved organic matter concentrations via the microbial loop and, in other rivers, after periods of high discharge or leaf fall that increase the amount of terrestrial material in the particulate organic matter pool.

These effects can alter water quality, primary production as well as habitat. Land development often fragments hydrologic connectivity within aquatic ecosystems forcing alterations in nutrient transport and increases the potential for eutrophication.

To investigate these influences a short sediment core was collected from within Dove Sound and investigated using Ã‚²Ã‚¹Ã¢°Pb dating, stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, and sedimentary pigments. Results indicated that Dove Sound has undergone eutrophication and the primary producer community structure has shifted from dominantly macrophytic to a system that supports substantial algal production.

The forest is composed of two distinct sections that were hydrologically enhanced in 2001. To approximate natural flooding, the north section was enhanced by cutting three breaches in a more than 70-year-old artificial levee. A fourth breach was cut from a natural riverbank in the south section to connect a lateral swale and augment the existing flood regime. The objective of this study was to evaluate various factors that might affect forest productivity after restoration. In 2004, ANPP for the forest was estimated at 847 plus or minus 50 g m super(-2) yr super(-1) (807 plus or minus 86 g m super(-2) yr super(-1) in the north section and 869 plus or minus 86 g m super(-2) yr super(-1) in the south section). Mean ANPP for the entire forest was similar to an estimate prior to restoration and still below productivity levels reported at other bottomland forests along the Olentnagy River and throughout the Midwest U.S. As part of this study, the influence of flood connectivity and other variables on intra-forest ANPP were also examined. Using daily river-stage data and by monitoring study plots at various flood stages, we estimated the number of days each plot was connected to the river. A significant and positive relationship was detected between plot ANPP and the number of days connected to the river during the 2004 water year (Oct. 2003-Sept. 2004).

"108","linkages between flow regime, biota, and ecosystem processes: implications for river restoration","River restoration guided by research Human activities have altered the flow regimes of many of Earth's rivers, with negative impacts on biodiversity, water quality, and ecological processes. In a Review, Palmer and Ruhi explain how restoration designs now attempt to mimic ecologically important aspects of natural flow regimes, guided by insights into how variations in flow affect biota and ecosystem processes. To be successful, such efforts must go beyond accounting for flood pulses to restore natural flow variability and achieve hydrological connectivity between a river and its surroundings. Science , this issue p. eaaw2087 BACKGROUND Early civilizations developed around seasonal river floodplains, and the natural rhythm of rivers remains critical to humans today. We use streams and rivers to meet drinking water, irrigation, and hydropower needs by storing and moving water in complex ways, at the times and places of our choosing. Consequently, many of Earth’s rivers have flow regimes that are “unnatural” in magnitude, frequency, duration, and timing. The rise in river degradation globally has motivated research on the link between hydrologic alteration and declines in valued biota. At the same time, largely fueled by new technologies and methods, research has expanded to understand the patterns in, and drivers of, riverine processes like primary production, in both near-pristine and degraded rivers. A third line of research, stymied by how difficult it has been to restore degraded rivers, has called for process-based restoration, building on knowledge from the other two research thrusts. Today’s hydroecological science seeks to understand the mechanisms whereby flow regimes affect biota and ecosystem processes, and the interplay between them, in a three-way interaction we call the flow-biota-ecosystem processes nexus. ADVANCES By shifting the focus from static patterns at sites to dynamic processes along river networks, advances are being made to understand the interactions and feedbacks at the nexus. Fueled by increasingly available time-series data and novel modeling, emerging research ranges from studies on regime-based properties such as flow periodicity and its change, to studies on river network structure and associated spatial variation in flow and water chemistry. These studies demonstrate how flow variability influences long-term persistence of riverine assemblages, and they are disentangling the direct effects of flow on communities and ecosystem processes from its indirect effects (e.g., via species interactions, light-blocking turbidity). Changes in temporal patterns in flow magnitudes can increase risk of community collapse and alter key ecosystem processes such as primary production. Growing research shows that storm flows not only enhance inputs and downstream export of terrestrially derived carbon to rivers but, when associated with sustained hydrologic connectivity with soils, exert particular influence on water chemistry and biogeochemical processes that can influence food webs. Increased availability of environmental sensors has stimulated research, showing that extreme flows may impart disproportionate impacts on stream metabolism, but the relationship can depend on the predictability of those flows. Research combining changes in flow patterns with stable isotope analyses is revealing how temporal fluctuations in habitat, and in the quality and quantity of basal resources, influence trophic pathways and resulting food-web structure. Evidence suggests that restoring particular facets of a flow regime can produce desirable conservation outcomes, but context is paramount. Restoration actions going beyond discrete flow events and enhancing groundwater-influenced river habitat or redirecting subsurface flow paths may be critical in future climates. OUTLOOK Our understanding of the flow-biota-ecosystem processes nexus is still incomplete and is a frontier research topic. Challenges include connecting organismal and ecosystem-level processes, and understanding the role of microbial communities as intermediaries. Capturing the effects of watershed-level physical and biogeochemical heterogeneity, and parsing out direct, indirect, or cascading effects of flow alteration on biota and processes would also reduce uncertainty in restoration outcomes, particularly in novel, nonstationary environments. Understanding how much flow restoration alone can achieve in urban watersheds is an urgent need, as is translating findings from hydroecology to design green infrastructure and flow release programs from reservoirs. These management tools may offer growing opportunities to experiment with flow regimes, which will assist in refining process-based river restoration. Both solid science, and effective translation into practice will be needed to curb the fast pace of global river ecosystem degradation. River ecosystems are highly biodiverse, influence global biogeochemical cycles, and provide valued services. However, humans are increasingly degrading fluvial ecosystems by altering their streamflows. Effective river restoration requires advancing our mechanistic understanding of how flow regimes affect biota and ecosystem processes. Here, we review emerging advances in hydroecology relevant to this goal. Spatiotemporal variation in flow exerts direct and indirect control on the composition, structure, and dynamics of communities at local to regional scales. Streamflows also influence ecosystem processes, such as nutrient uptake and transformation, organic matter processing, and ecosystem metabolism. We are deepening our understanding of how biological processes, not just static patterns, affect and are affected by stream ecosystem processes. However, research on this nexus of flow-biota-ecosystem processes is at an early stage. We illustrate this frontier with evidence from highly altered regulated rivers and urban streams. We also identify research challenges that should be prioritized to advance process-based river restoration.",NA,2019,"DC","PG","n","rivers and streams","n",NA,NA,"n","perspective paper","pro_46",NA
"109","opening the tap: increased riverine connectivity strengthens marine food web pathways","Reduction of ecosystem connectivity has long-lasting impacts on food webs. Anadromous fish, which migrate from marine to freshwater ecosystems to complete reproduction, have seen their historically larger ecosystem role undercut by widespread riverine habitat fragmentation and other impacts mainly derived from anthropogenic sources. The result has been extensive extirpations and increased susceptibility to a suite of environmental factors that currently impede recovery. Under this present-day context of reduced productivity and connectivity, aggressive management actions and enforcement of catch limits including bycatch caps and complete moratoria on harvest have followed. What remains less understood are the implications of changes to food webs that co-occurred. What benefits restoration could provide in terms of ecosystem functioning in relation to economic costs associated with dam removal and remediation is unknown and can limit the scope and value of restoration activities. Here we employ, historical landscape-based biomass estimates of anadromous alosine for the first time in an ecosystem modeling of the Northeast US large marine ecosystem ( LME), to evaluate the value of improving connectivity by measuring the increase in energy flow and population productivity. We compared a restored alosine model to a contemporary model, analyzing the impacts of the potential increase of connectivity between riverine and oceanic systems. There was the potential for a moderate biomass increase of piscivorous species with high economic value, including Atlantic cod, and for a major increase for species of conservation concern such as pelagic sharks, seabirds and marine mammals. Our study highlights the benefits of increased connectivity between freshwater and ocean ecosystems. We demonstrate the significant role anadromous forage fish could play in improving specific fisheries and overall ecosystem functioning, mainly through the diversification of species capable of transferring primary production to upper trophic levels, adding to benefits associated with their restoration.","Dias, Beatriz S.; Frisk, Michael G.; Jordaan, Adrian",2019,"DC","MB","y","marine and freshwater connection","y","fish biomass","health of anadromous fish stocks?","n","marine","pro_53",NA
"110","river and wetland food webs in australia's wet-dry tropics: general principles and implications for management","The tropical rivers of northern Australia have received international and national recognition for their high ecological and cultural values. Unlike many tropical systems elsewhere in the world and their temperate Australian counterparts, they have largely unmodified flow regimes and are comparatively free from the impacts associated with intensive land use. However, there is growing demand for agricultural development and existing pressures, such as invasive plants and feral animals, threaten their ecological integrity. Using the international literature to provide a conceptual framework and drawing on limited published and unpublished data on rivers in northern Australia, we have derived five general principles about food webs and related ecosystem processes that both characterise tropical rivers of northern Australia and have important implications for their management. These are: ( 1) the seasonal hydrology is a strong driver of ecosystem processes and food-web structure; ( 2) hydrological connectivity is largely intact and underpins important terrestrial-aquatic food-web subsidies; ( 3) river and wetland food webs are strongly dependent on algal production; ( 4) a few common macroconsumer species have a strong influence on benthic food webs; and ( 5) omnivory is widespread and food chains are short. The implications of these ecosystem attributes for the management and protection of tropical rivers and wetlands of northern Australian are discussed in relation to known threats. These principles provide a framework for the formation of testable hypotheses in future research programmes.","Douglas, Michael M.; Bunn, Stuart E.; Davies, Peter M.",2005,"DC","RP","n","river","y?",NA,"not defined","n","perspective paper","pro_60",NA
"111","the effects of river floodwaters on floodplain wetland water quality and diatom assemblages","We investigated the effects of river floodpulses on the water chemistry and diatom assemblages in a floodplain wetland. During the two year study period (November 2003-September 2005), the river and wetland exhibited three periods of surface hydrologic connectivity. The impacts of flooding depended on flood magnitude and duration. Both the long/high magnitude and short/high magnitude floods thoroughly mixed river and wetland waters, with conductivity, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus in the wetland decreasing to levels similar to the river. In contrast, the short/low magnitude flood did not mix water chemistry. Wetland conductivity, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus remained elevated. Changes in algal biomass followed changes in water chemistry with the high magnitude floods producing conditions unfavorable for algal growth. Algal biomass decreased in the wetland coinciding with the two high magnitude floods. Increases in algal biomass coincided with the short/low magnitude flood. Wetland and river water column diatom assemblages were dominated by periphytic taxa. The diatom assemblage in the river and wetland were distinct, except during the short/high magnitude flood. During this period, floodwaters brought diatoms into the wetland and both systems were dominated by planktonic centric taxa. Similar diatom taxa were observed in the wetland water column assemblage and the assemblage collected in settling chambers, although their relative abundances varied. Shifts in the settling diatom assemblage coincided with periods of flooding, indicating that river floodwaters leave a discernable signal within this assemblage. Our findings indicate that caution should be exercised when using diatom-based bioassessment in frequently flooded wetlands as the wetland diatom assemblage is influenced by river floodwaters and changes may depend on the duration and magnitude of flooding.","Weilhoefer, Christine L.; Pan, Yangdong; Eppard, Sara",2008,"DC","RP","n","river and floodplain","y","algal and diatom biomass","flood magnitude and duration","y",NA,"pro_67",NA
"112","trophic structure of apex fish communities in closed versus leaky lakes of arctic alaska","Despite low species diversity and primary production, trophic structure (e.g., top predator species, predator size) is surprisingly variable among Arctic lakes. We investigated trophic structure in lakes of arctic Alaska containing arctic char Salvelinus alpinus using stomach contents and stable isotope ratios in two geographically-close but hydrologically-distinct lake clusters to investigate how these fish may interact and compete for limited food resources. Aside from different lake connectivity patterns (‘leaky’ versus ‘closed’), differing fish communities (up to five versus only two species) between lake clusters allowed us to test trophic hypotheses including: (1) arctic char are more piscivorous, and thereby grow larger and obtain higher trophic positions, in the presence of other fish species; and, (2) between arctic char size classes, resource polymorphism is more prominent, and thereby trophic niches are narrower and overlap less, in the absence of other predators. Regardless of lake cluster, we observed little direct evidence of arctic char consuming other fishes, but char were larger (mean TL = 468 vs 264 mm) and trophic position was higher (mean TP = 4.0 vs 3.8 for large char) in lakes with other fishes. Further, char demonstrated less intraspecific overlap when other predators were present whereas niche overlap was up to 100% in closed, char only lakes. As hydrologic characteristics (e.g., lake connectivity, water temperatures) will change across the Arctic owing to climate change, our results provide insight regarding potential concomitant changes to fish interactions and increase our understanding of lake trophic structure to guide management and conservation goals.","Klobucar, Stephen L;Budy, Phaedra",2020,"DC","CP","n","lake","y","arctic char diet","lake connectivity; leaky vs. closed","n","not related to primary productivity but predation","pro_74",NA

Climate change projections show increased drought severity in drylands that could compromise wetland resilience and reduce important habitat services. These recognized risks have been difficult to evaluate due to our limited capacity to establish comprehensive relationships between flood-drought episodes and vegetation responses at the relevant spatiotemporal scales. We address this issue by integrating detailed spatiotemporal flood-drought simulations with remotely sensed vegetation responses to water regimes in a dryland wetland known for its highly variable inundation. We show that a combination of drought tolerance and dormancy strategies allow wetland vegetation to recover after droughts and recolonize areas invaded by terrestrial species. However, climate change scenarios show widespread degradation during drought and limited recovery after floods. Importantly, the combination of degradation extent and increase in drought duration is critical for the habitat services wetland systems provide for waterbirds and fish.","Sandi, Steven G;Rodriguez, Jose F;Saintilan, Neil;Wen, Li;Kuczera, George;Riccardi, Gerardo;Saco, Patricia M",2020,"check","DC","n","terrestrial wetland","y","vegetation",NA,"y","terrestrial wetland responses to flooding after drought","pro_59",NA

Floodplain rivers in Australia's wet/dry tropics are regarded as being among the most ecologically intact and bio-diverse lotic ecosystems in the world, yet there have been relatively few community-based studies of their aquatic fauna. 2. To investigate relationships between hydrological connectivity and biodiversity in the region, macroinvertebrates were collected from sites within two contrasting floodplain rivers, the 'tropical' Gregory River and 'dryland' Flinders River systems, during the dry season and analysed at various spatial scales. A subset of sites was re-sampled in the following dry season to explore temporal variation. The fauna consisted of 124 morphotaxa, dominated by gatherers and the Insecta. 3. As predicted, hydrological connectivity (the lotic or lentic status of waterbodies) had a major influence on macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and diversity, both in space and time. Assemblages from waterbodies with similar connection histories were most alike, and beta-diversity between assemblages was greatest between lotic and lentic waterbodies, tending to increase with increasing spatial separation. 4. At smaller spatial scales, a number of within-waterbody, habitat and water quality characteristics were important for explaining variation (61%) in the taxonomic organization of assemblages, and characteristics associated with primary productivity and habitat diversity were important for explaining variation (45%) in the functional organization of assemblages. However, much of the small-scale environmental variation across the study region appeared to be related to broad-scale variation in hydrological connectivity, which had both direct and indirect effects on macroinvertebrate assemblages. 5.

The effects of floodplain hydrology and environmental attributes on structural aspects of biotic assemblages have been extensively studied, but responses at the functional level remain largely unknown. Here, we characterised a central aspect of food-web architecture, the food chain length, as the maximum trophic position within 24 macroinvertebrate communities of parafluvial habitats in the Maggia river floodplain, in Switzerland. We investigated how the food chain length changed with different levels of habitat size, primary productivity and disturbance, the three factors potentially affecting food chain length in both theoretical and empirical studies. We found that food chain length was lower in frequently flooded habitats and immediately after a flood. We also showed that trophic omnivory, where predators fed at lower trophic levels after flooding, and in more frequently flooded habitats, may explain these changes. These findings show that trophic omnivory may explain how predators resist disturbance and are maintained in highly dynamic landscapes. More importantly, given that trophic omnivory may overall weaken trophic linkages and thus increase food-web stability, this suggests that it could be a key mechanism in sustaining biodiversity in river floodplains.","Chanut, Pierre C.

"116","20-years cumulative impact from shrimp farming on mangroves of northeast brazil","Brazilian mangroves cover about 11,100 km(2) and provide a wide range of ecosystem services. Despite their importance, they are one of the most impacted ecosystems because of combined influences of climate change, pollution, and direct conversion and loss. A major driver of environmental impacts is shrimp farming and this is particularly acute in the semi-arid northeast of Brazil, where mangroves are constrained in a narrow band along ephemeral estuaries that are often impacted by multi-year droughts. Recent changes to Brazilian law, in particular the Forest Code, have weakened protection for mangroves and associated apicum (salt pan) ecosystems. In NE Brazil, most shrimp ponds are converted from mangrove-adjacent apicuns rather than the mangroves themselves with periodic hydrological connectivity through dammed channels, allowing the flushing of effluents. As a result, the main impacts on mangroves are typically indirect, because of pollution inputs from shrimp pond effluents and associated loss of ecosystem services including reductions in primary productivity, carbon storage capacity, resilience to other environmental stressors, their efficiency as estuarine filters, and biodiversity and abundance of subsistence use of marine species. Soil damage and infrastructure remaining after shrimp pond deactivation impairs mangrove recovery. This extends the duration of the damage and allows the occupation of degraded areas by other activities that can permanently impair ecosystem function. In this review, we address several aspects of the shrimp culture boom in NE Brazilian, their features and consequences, and the future of mangroves in the region considering climate change and rising poverty. Our conclusions on the practices and outcomes of shrimp farming in mangroves are likely to apply to areas with similar environmental settings, e.g., semiarid regions worldwide, and particularly in the Latin America and Caribbean region, and our findings can be taken into account to improve conservation and management of these forests at the least to a regional scale.","de Lacerda, Luiz Drude; Ward, Raymond D.; Godoy, Mario Duarte Pinto; de Andrade Meireles, Antonio Jeovah; Borges, Rebecca; Ferreira, Alexander Cesar",2021,"MB","ES","y","estuary","n",NA,NA,"n","review paper; about the impact of shrimp farming on mangroves","pro_1","type"

By supplying nutrients to coastal ecosystems at levels comparable to intensive agriculture practices, roosting colonial waterbirds provide a natural experimental design to examine the impacts of anthropogenic nutrient enrichment in these systems. We tested the hypothesis that long-term nutrient enrichment from bird guano deposition is linked to declines in island size, which may subsequently decrease the stability and resilience of mangrove cays in Belize. We combined remote sensing analysis with field- and lab-based measurements of forest structure, sediment nutrients, and porewater nutrients on three pairs of rookery and control cays in northern, central, and southern Belize. Our results indicate that rookery cays are disappearing approximately 13 times faster than cays without seasonal or resident seabird populations. Rookery cays were associated with a significantly higher concentration of nitrogen (N) in mangrove leaves and greater aboveground biomass, suggesting that eutrophication from bird guano contributes to increased aboveground productivity. Sediments of rookery cays also had lower percentages of soil organic matter and total N and carbon (C) than control islands, which suggests that eutrophication accelerates organic matter decomposition resulting in lower total C stocks on rookery cays. Our results indicate that coastal eutrophication can reduce ecosystem stability by contributing to accelerated cay loss, with potential consequences for mangrove resilience to environmental variability under contemporary and future climatic scenarios.","Simpson, L T;Canty, S W J;Cissell, J R;Steinberg, M K;Cherry, J A;Feller, I C",2021,"MB","CP","y","coastal","y","forest structure, sediment nutrients, porewater nutrients",NA,"n",NA,"pro_8","marine"
"118","diel cycles of delta c-13(dic) and ecosystem metabolism in ephemeral dryland streams","Streams in hot, arid environments often exist as a series of isolated pools along main channels. During these periods, shallow alluvial through flow may strongly influence key ecological processes within pools. We measured diel changes in delta C-13 values of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) in two pools of ephemeral, dryland streams. We quantified alluvial water connectivity through stable isotope analysis (delta O-18 and delta H-2) of pool and alluvial water. We also estimated gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) rates across a wider set of pools in both streams. delta C-13(DIC) values displayed regular diel cycles, where both pools displayed small but similar daily amplitude (0.7-0.9 parts per thousand) despite contrasting amplitudes of change in DO (0.8 mg L-1 vs. 2.8 mg L-1) and contrasting alluvial water connectivity (connected vs. disconnected). Water temperature was the strongest predictor of both delta C-13(DIC) values and rates of change in delta C-13(DIC) across both pools. Across both streams, all pools were net heterotrophic. GPP (0.35-1.73 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) and ER (0.49-2.64 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) rates were linked to aquatic vegetation cover. The disconnect between diurnal amplitudes of delta C-13 values and DO concentrations thus suggests that ecological drivers of gas exchange became increasingly localised as pools contracted.","Siebers, Andre R.; Pettit, Neil E.; Skrzypek, Grzegorz; Dogramaci, Shawan; Grierson, Pauline F.",2020,"MB","CP","n","stream","y","delta c-13 of DIC and DO","connected / disconnected","y",NA,"pro_15",""
"119","effect of hydrological connectivity on the phosphorus buffering capacity of an urban floodplain","Floodplains can perform nutrient buffering functions and therefore influence the riverine nutrient dynamics depending on the extent of the hydrological connectivity. This work focused on quantifying the adsorption/desorption potential of a degraded floodplain of the Danube River (Lower Lobau) based on sediment characterization (grain size distribution, organic content, and P-fractions) and sediment type-specific P-adsorption via batch experiments. We established an adsorption/desorption budget model with a high temporal and spatial resolution. With this model, we identified spatial patterns related to hydrology and calculated the phosphorus buffering capacity of permanent and temporary floodplain water bodies. Sediment characteristics were defined by the distance to the inflow area and the hydrological connectivity of the floodplain water bodies. The main factor for the concentration of total phosphorus (Ptot) in the sediments was the grain size distribution. Ptot was ten times higher in silt-dominated sediments compared to gravel-dominated sediments. Inorganic phosphorus (Pinorg) ranged between 36 and 90% depending on the organic content of the sediments. Both the adsorption and the desorption potential of SRP (soluble reactive phosphorus) were highest in large, frequently connected water bodies and were strongly controlled by hydrology. The total adsorption potential of the floodplain was up to 40 times higher in wet years (e.g., 2002) than in dry years (e.g., 2003), when floodplain water bodies were connected less frequently to the main channel of the Danube. Up to 75% of the adsorbed SRP was desorbed and released into the water column after periods of connection. Consequently, SRP adsorption directly reduced the P-load in the Danube River main channel. The adsorption/desorption mechanisms worked as a buffering system by taking up the SRP imported during floods and releasing it over a longer period after the floods. This stimulated high primary production in the floodplain water bodies and impacted the overall P-retention of the floodplain.","Preiner, Stefan;Bondar-Kunze, Elisabeth;Pitzl, Beate;Weigelhofer, Gabriele;Hein, Thomas",2020,"MB","LY","n","floodplain","y","phosphorus absorption","wet/dry; connected/disconnected","y",NA,"pro_22",""
"120","groundwater‐river water exchange enhances growing season evapotranspiration and carbon uptake in a semiarid riparian ecosystem","Semiarid ecosystems play a critical role in determining the interannual variability of the global terrestrial carbon sink. Water availability is a critical driver of productivity in semiarid ecosystems, which often alternate between carbon sink/source functioning during wet/dry years. In this study, we investigate how groundwater availability resulting from groundwater‐river water exchange influences net ecosystem exchange of CO 2 (NEE), evapotranspiration (ET), and the surface energy balance at two semiarid ecosystems along the Columbia River in central Washington, USA. We examined 1&#xa0;year of eddy covariance measurements from an upland sagebrush ecosystem primarily fed by rainfall without groundwater access and a riparian grassland ecosystem with groundwater access during the dry season due to lateral groundwater‐river water exchange. The two sites had distinct seasonal patterns of NEE and ET, driven by differences in water availability. While NEE at the upland sagebrush site was strongly constrained by water availability during the dry months, access to groundwater allowed the riparian site to maintain high NEE magnitude and ET during the same dry months. The riparian site had larger annual gross primary productivity than the upland site (612 vs. 424&#xa0;gC/m 2 ), which was offset by higher ecosystem respiration (558 vs. 363&#xa0;gC/m 2 ). Thus, the magnitude of the annual NEE at the upland site was larger than that at the riparian site (−62 vs. −54&#xa0;gC/m 2 ). Our results demonstrate that groundwater access determined by connectivity between groundwater and surface water can be a critical driver of carbon uptake and ET in semiarid ecosystems.","Missik, Justine E C;Liu, Heping;Gao, Zhongming;Huang, Maoyi;Chen, Xingyuan;Arntzen, Evan;Mcfarland, Douglas P;Ren, Huiying;Titzler, P Scott;Thomle, Jonathan N;Goldman, Amy",2019,"MB","PG","n","not aquatic","y","net ecosystem exchange, evapotranspiration",NA,"n","not aquatic, about the impact of groundwater availability on terrestrial plants","pro_29","not aquatic"
"121","hydrological control of system characteristics of floodplain lakes","Water bodies within floodplains are strongly governed by their hydrological connectivity with the main river (Heiler et al. 1995). Connectivity is decisive for the general ecosystem characteristics and the balance between input and output of nutrients and organic carbon sources. A major determinant is the abundance of macrophytic vegetation, which is controlled by through-flow, dry-falling and scouring effects. The autochthonous primary production is strongly augmented by local terrestrial carbon sources and by the riverine transport in form of dissolved and particulate organic matter. The significance of these different sources depends on hydrology. Flood pulses represent a disturbance to pelagic communities (followed by successions) and a source of nutrients. High loads of inorganic nutrients produce conditions for prolific algal growth. High availability of allochthonous organic carbon provides the basis for a prolific bacterial secondary production. Our data emphasize that the stimulus of local aquatic primary production enhances carbon utilization by bacteria.","Schiemer, F;Hein, T;Peduzzi, P",2006,"MB","LY","n","floodplain","y","bacterial secondary production","flood pulse","y",NA,"pro_36",""
"122","landscape ecology: a framework for integrating pattern and process in river corridors","Investigations of European floodplain rivers demonstrate how landscape ecology can provide an effective framework to integrate pattern and process in river corridors, to examine environmental dynamics and interactive pathways between landscape elements, and to develop viable strategies for river conservation. The highly complex and dynamic nature of intact river corridors is particularly amenable to a landscape ecology perspective. Analysis of spatial patterns has provided considerable insight into environmental heterogeneity across river corridors and is an essential prelude to examining dynamic interactions. For example, data from aerial photographs, digitized maps and year-round field measurements in a glacial flood plain, enabled us to distinguish six channel types, based on the correspondence between connectivity and physicochemical attributes. Spatial data were also used to analyze longitudinal changes in landscape elements along the course of a morphologically-intact riverine corridor, providing insight into the structural complexity that must have characterized many Alpine rivers in the pristine state. Landscape indices were employed to investigate seasonal dynamics in a glacial flood plain of the Swiss Alps which exhibits a predictable expansion/contraction cycle, with corresponding shifts in flow paths (surface and subsurface) and water sources (snowmelt, englacial, subglacial, alluvial aquifer, hillslope aquifer). Surface connectivity exhibited an unexpected biphasic relationship with total channel length, whereas riverscape diversity progressively increased along the entire range of channel length. Reconstituting the functional integrity that characterizes intact river corridors should perhaps be the major goal of river conservation initiatives. Although understanding functional processes at the landscape scale is essential in this regard, few data are available. In the Alluvial Zone National Park on the Austrian Danube, three phases of hydrological connectivity were identified (disconnection, seepage connection and surface connection) that corresponded to the predominance of three functional processes (biotic interactions, primary production and particulate transport) within the river corridor.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","Ward, J V;Malard, Florian;Tockner, Klement",2002,"MB","CP","n","river","y","floodplain dynamics, surface connectivity","unclear","y",NA,"pro_43",""

The present study explored the spatiotemporal dynamics of wetlands, prediction of wetland risk assessment. The wetland risk assessment was predicted based on ten selected parameters, such as fragmentation probability, distance to road, and settlement. We used M5P, random forest (RF), reduced error pruning tree (REPTree), and support vector machine (SVM) machine learning techniques for wetland risk assessment. The results showed that wetland areas at present are declining less than one-third of those in 1988 due to the construction of the dam at Farakka, which is situated at the upstream of the Padma River. The distance to the river and built-up area are the two most contributing drivers influencing the wetland risk assessment based on information gain ratio (InGR). The prediction results of machine learning models showed 64.48% of area by M5P, 61.75% of area by RF, 62.18% of area by REPTree, and 55.74% of area by SVM have been predicted as the high and very high-risk zones. The results of accuracy assessment showed that the RF outperformed than other models (area under curve: 0.83), followed by the SVM, M5P, and REPTree. Degradation of wetlands explored in this study demonstrated the negative effects on biodiversity. Therefore, to conserve and protect the wetlands, continuous monitoring of wetlands using high resolution satellite images, feeding with the ecological flow, confining built up area and agricultural expansion towards wetlands, and new wetland creation is essential for wetland management.","Islam, Abu Reza Md Towfiqul;Talukdar, Swapan;Mahato, Susanta;Ziaul, Sk;Eibek, Kutub Uddin;Akhter, Shumona;Pham, Quoc Bao;Mohammadi, Babak;Karimi, Firoozeh;Linh, Nguyen Thi Thuy",2021,"MB","ES","n","wetland","y","wetland risk assessment","unclear","y",NA,"pro_50",""
"124","reach-scale river metabolism across contrasting sub-catchment geologies; effect of light and hydrology","We investigated the seasonal dynamics of in-stream metabolism at the reach scale ( approximately 150 m) of headwaters across contrasting geological sub-catchments: clay, Greensand, and Chalk of the upper River Avon (UK). Benthic metabolic activity was quantified by aquatic eddy co-variance while water column activity was assessed by bottle incubations. Seasonal dynamics across reaches were specific for the three types of geologies. During the spring, all reaches were net autotrophic, with rates of up to 290 mmol C m (super -2) d (super -1) in the clay reach. During the remaining seasons, the clay and Greensand reaches were net heterotrophic, with peak oxygen consumption of 206 mmol m (super -2) d (super -1) during the autumn, while the Chalk reach was net heterotrophic only in winter. Overall, the water column alone still contributed to approximately 25% of the annual respiration and primary production in all reaches. Net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) across seasons and reaches followed a general linear relationship with increasing stream light availability. Sub-catchment specific NEM proved to be linearly related to the local hydrological connectivity, quantified as the ratio between base flow and stream discharge, and expressed on a timescale of 9 d on average. This timescale apparently represents the average period of hydrological imprint for carbon turnover within the reaches. Combining a general light response and sub-catchment specific base flow ratio provided a robust functional relationship for predicting NEM at the reach scale. The novel approach proposed in this study can help facilitate spatial and temporal upscaling of riverine metabolism that may be applicable to a broader spectrum of catchments.

"125","temperature and precipitation drive temporal variability in aquatic carbon and ghg concentrations and fluxes in a peatland catchment","The aquatic pathway is increasingly being recognized as an important component of catchment carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets, particularly in peatland systems due to their large carbon store and strong hydrological connectivity. In this study, we present a complete 5-year data set of all aquatic carbon and GHG species from an ombrotrophic Scottish peatland. Measured species include particulate and dissolved forms of organic carbon (POC, DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2, CH4 and N2O. We show that short-term variability in concentrations exists across all species and this is strongly linked to discharge. Seasonal cyclicity was only evident in DOC,CO2 and CH4 concentration; however, temperature correlated with monthly means in all species except DIC. Although the temperature correlation with monthly DOC and POC concentrations appeared to be related to biological productivity in the terrestrial system, we suggest the temperature correlation with CO2 and CH4 was primarily due to in-stream temperature-dependent solubility. Interannual variability in total aquatic carbon concentration was strongly correlated with catchment gross primary productivity (GPP) indicating a strong potential terrestrial aquatic linkage. DOC represented the largest aquatic carbon flux term (19.3 plus or minus 4.59 g C m-2 yr-1), followed by CO2 evasion (10.0 g C m-2 yr-1). Despite an estimated contribution to the total aquatic carbon flux of between 8 and 48%, evasion estimates had the greatest uncertainty. Interannual variability in total aquatic carbon export was low in comparison with variability in terrestrial biosphere-atmosphere exchange, and could be explained primarily by temperature and precipitation. Our results therefore suggest that climatic change is likely to have a significant impact on annual carbon losses through the aquatic pathway, and as such, aquatic exports are fundamental to the understanding of whole catchment responses to climate change.","Dinsmore, K J;Billett, M F;Dyson, KE",2013,"MB","PG","n","peatland","y","forms of organic carbon","none","n",NA,"pro_64","connectivity"
"126","tracking the resource pulse: movement responses of fish to dynamic floodplain habitat in a tropical river","Natural river floodplains are among the Earth's most biologically diverse and productive ecosystems but face a range of critical threats due to human disturbance. Understanding the ecological processes that support biodiversity and productivity in floodplain rivers is essential for their future protection and rehabilitation. Fish assemblage structure on tropical river floodplains is widely considered to be driven by dispersal limitation during the wet season and by environmental filtering and interspecific interactions during the dry season. However, the individual-level movement behaviours (e.g. site attachment, nomadism, homing) that regulate dispersal of fish on floodplains are poorly understood. We combined radiotelemetry and remote sensing to examine the movement behaviour of two large-bodied fishes (barramundi Lates calcarifer, forktail catfish Neoarius leptaspis) over the flood cycle in a tropical river-floodplain system in northern Australia to: (a) quantify movement responses in relation to dynamic habitat resources at a landscape scale; and (b) determine the extent of spatial 'reshuffling' of individual fish following the wet season. Both species altered their behaviour rapidly in response to changes in the availability and distribution of aquatic habitat, with most individuals undertaking extensive movements (up to similar to 27 km from the tagging location) on the inundated floodplain during the wet season. Although there was considerable individual variation in movement patterns, overall barramundi distributions closely tracked the extent of floodplain primary productivity, whereas catfish distributions were most closely associated with the extent of flooded area. Most individuals of both species exhibited homing back to previously occupied dry season refugia during the wet-to-dry transition, even though other potential refugia were available in closer proximity to wet season activity areas. We postulate that homing behaviour modulates temporal variation in fish assemblage composition and abundance and limits the transfer of aquatic-derived energy and nutrients into terrestrial food webs by reducing fish mortality on drying floodplains. Our study demonstrates the importance of quantifying individual-level behaviour across the three stages of dispersal (emigration, inter-patch movement, immigration) for our understanding of how animal movement influences energetic subsidies and other large-scale ecosystem processes.","Crook, David A.; Buckle, Duncan J.; Morrongiello, John R.; Allsop, Quentin A.; Baldwin, Wayne; Saunders, Thor M.; Douglas, Michael M.",2020,"MB","ES","n","floodplain","y","fish movement","inundated / not inundated","y",NA,"pro_71",""

Here, we incorporate key factors that affect soil bacterial abundance and diversity across spatial scales into a mechanistic modeling framework considering soil type, carbon inputs and climate towards predicting soil bacterial diversity. The soil aqueous-phase content and connectivity exert strong influence on bacterial diversity for each soil type and rainfall pattern. Biome-specific carbon inputs deduced from net primary productivity provide constraints on soil bacterial abundance independent from diversity. The proposed heuristic model captures observed global trends of bacterial diversity in good agreement with predictions by an individual-based mechanistic model. Bacterial diversity is highest at intermediate water contents where the aqueous phase forms numerous disconnected habitats and soil carrying capacity determines level of occupancy. The framework delineates global soil bacterial diversity hotspots; located mainly in climatic transition zones that are sensitive to potential climate and land use changes. Numerous micro- and macro-scale factors influence soil microbial diversity. Here the authors create a model to demonstrate that fine scale soil moisture influences the carrying capacity of microbes, which then scales up to larger biogeographic patterns.","Bickel, Samuel;Or Dani",2020,"check","MB","n","not aquatic","y","soil bacterial abundance and diversity","soil aqueous-phase content","n",NA,"pro_61","connectivity"
"128","a vital link: water and vegetation in the anthropocene","This paper argues that the interplay of water, carbon and vegetation dynamics fundamentally links some global trends in the current and conceivable future Anthropocene, such as cropland expansion, freshwater use, and climate change and its impacts. Based on a review of recent literature including geographically explicit simulation studies with the process-based LPJmL global biosphere model, it demonstrates that the connectivity of water and vegetation dynamics is vital for water security, food security and (terrestrial) ecosystem dynamics alike. The water limitation of net primary production of both natural and agricultural plants - already pronounced in many regions - is shown to increase in many places under projected climate change, though this development is partially offset by water-saving direct CO sub(2) effects. Natural vegetation can to some degree adapt dynamically to higher water limitation, but agricultural crops usually require some form of active management to overcome it - among them irrigation, soil conservation and eventually shifts of cropland to areas that are less water-limited due to more favourable climatic conditions. While crucial to secure food production for a growing world population, such human interventions in water-vegetation systems have, as also shown, repercussions on the water cycle. Indeed, land use changes are shown to be the second-most important influence on the terrestrial water balance in recent times. Furthermore, climate change (warming and precipitation changes) will in many regions increase irrigation demand and decrease water availability, impeding rainfed and irrigated food production (if not CO sub(2) effects counterbalance this impact - which is unlikely at least in poorly managed systems). Drawing from these exemplary investigations, some research perspectives on how to further improve our knowledge of human-water-vegetation interactions in the Anthropocene are outlined.","Gerten, D",2013,"check","MB","n","global freshwater","y",NA,NA,"n",NA,"pro_3","connectivity"
"129","opening the tap: increased riverine connectivity strengthens marine food web pathways","Reduction of ecosystem connectivity has long-lasting impacts on food webs. Anadromous fish, which migrate from marine to freshwater ecosystems to complete reproduction, have seen their historically larger ecosystem role undercut by widespread riverine habitat fragmentation and other impacts mainly derived from anthropogenic sources. The result has been extensive extirpations and increased susceptibility to a suite of environmental factors that currently impede recovery. Under this present-day context of reduced productivity and connectivity, aggressive management actions and enforcement of catch limits including bycatch caps and complete moratoria on harvest have followed. What remains less understood are the implications of changes to food webs that co-occurred. What benefits restoration could provide in terms of ecosystem functioning in relation to economic costs associated with dam removal and remediation is unknown and can limit the scope and value of restoration activities. Here we employ, historical landscape-based biomass estimates of anadromous alosine for the first time in an ecosystem modeling of the Northeast US large marine ecosystem ( LME), to evaluate the value of improving connectivity by measuring the increase in energy flow and population productivity. We compared a restored alosine model to a contemporary model, analyzing the impacts of the potential increase of connectivity between riverine and oceanic systems. There was the potential for a moderate biomass increase of piscivorous species with high economic value, including Atlantic cod, and for a major increase for species of conservation concern such as pelagic sharks, seabirds and marine mammals. Our study highlights the benefits of increased connectivity between freshwater and ocean ecosystems. We demonstrate the significant role anadromous forage fish could play in improving specific fisheries and overall ecosystem functioning, mainly through the diversification of species capable of transferring primary production to upper trophic levels, adding to benefits associated with their restoration.","Dias, Beatriz S.; Frisk, Michael G.; Jordaan, Adrian",2019,"check","MB","partial","ocean and river","y","energy flow, population productivity","ocean-river connectivity","n",NA,"pro_53","marine"
"130","analysis of anthropogenic, climatological, and morphological influences on dissolved organic matter in rocky mountain streams","In recent decades, the Rocky Mountains (RM) have undergone significant changes associated with anthropogenic activities and natural disturbances. These changes have the potential to alter primary productivity and biomass carbon storage. In particular, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in RM streams can affect heterotrophic processes, act as a source for the nutrient cycle, absorb sunlight radiation, alter metal transport, and can promote the production of carcinogenic byproducts during water treatment. Recent studies have focused on the relationship between bark beetle infestations and stream organic matter but have reached conflicting conclusions. Consequently, here we compile and process multiple datasets representing features of the RM for the period 1983–2012 with the purpose of assessing their relative influence on stream DOC concentrations using spatial statistical modeling. Features representing climate, land cover, forest disturbances, topography, soil types, and anthropogenic activities are included. We focus on DOC during base-flow conditions in RM streams because base-flow concentrations are more representative of the longer-term (annual to decadal) impacts and are less dependent on episodic, short-term storm and runoff/erosion events. To predict DOC throughout the network, we use a stream network model in a 56,550 km2 area to address the intrinsic connectivity and hydrologic directionality of the stream network. Natural forest disturbances are positively correlated with increased DOC concentrations; however, the effect of urbanization is far greater. Similarly, higher maximum temperatures, which can be exacerbated by climate change, are also associated with elevated DOC concentrations. Overall, DOC concentrations present an increasing trend over time in the RM region.","Rodríguez-Jeangros, Nicolás;McCray, John E;Hering, Amanda S",2018,"PG","DC","n","mountain stream","y","dissolved organic carbon","stream network model","y","probably wont be included in the end","pro_5",NA

Within areas where tree mortality has occurred, ecological, hydrological and meteorological consequences are increasingly being documented. However, the potential for tree die-off to impact vegetation processes and related carbon dynamics in areas remote to where die-off occurs has rarely been systematically evaluated, particularly for multiple distinct regions within a given continent. Such remote impacts can occur when climate effects of local vegetation change are propagated by atmospheric circulation—the phenomena of ‘ecoclimate teleconnections’. We simulated tree die-off events in the 13 most densely forested US regions (selected from the 20 US National Ecological Observatory Network [NEON] domains) and found that tree die-off even for smaller regions has potential to affect climate and hence Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) in disparate regions (NEON domains), either positively or negatively. Some regions exhibited strong teleconnections to several others, and some regions were relatively sensitive to tree loss regardless of what other region the tree loss occurred in. For the US as a whole, loss of trees in the Pacific Southwest—an area undergoing rapid tree die-off—had the largest negative impact on remote US GPP whereas loss of trees in the Mid-Atlantic had the largest positive impact. This research lays a foundation for hypotheses that identify how the effects of tree die-off (or other types of tree loss such as deforestation) can ricochet across regions by revealing hot-spots of forcing and response. Such modes of connectivity have direct applicability for improving models of climate change impacts and for developing more informed and coordinated carbon accounting across regions.","Swann, Abigail L S;Laguë, Marysa M;Garcia, Elizabeth S;Field, Jason P;Breshears, David D;Moore, David J P;Saleska, Scott R;Stark, Scott C;Juan Camilo Villegas;Law, Darin J;Minor, David M",2018,"PG","CP","n",NA,"y","tree die-off","NEON domains","n","forestry paper, not aquatic","pro_12","not aquatic"
"132","ecohydrology in semiarid urban ecosystems; modeling the relationship between connected impervious area and ecosystem productivity","In water-stressed, semiarid urban environments, connections between impervious surfaces and drainage networks may strongly impact the water use and ecosystem productivity of neighboring vegetated areas. We use an ecohydrologic model, the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys), to quantify the sensitivity of vegetation water use and net primary productivity (NPP) to fine-scale impervious surface connectivity. We develop a set of very fine-scale (2 m (super 2) ) scenarios that vary both the percentage of impervious surface and fraction of this impervious surface with direct hydrologic connections to urban drainage systems for a small hillslope. When driven by Mediterranean climate forcing, model estimates suggest that total vegetation water use declines with increasing impervious area. However, when impervious area is hydrologically disconnected from the urban drainage network, declines in water and carbon fluxes with decreased vegetated area can be partially, or in some cases even completely, offset by increased transpiration and NPP in the remaining vegetation. Relative increases in water use and NPP of remaining vegetation are much greater for deeply rooted shrubs and trees and negligible for shallow rooted grasses. We extrapolate our findings to the catchment scale by developing a first-order approximation of fine-scale impervious connection impacts on aggregate watershed water and carbon flux estimates. Our approach offers a computationally and data-efficient method for estimating the impact of impervious area connectivity on these ecohydrologic fluxes. For our only partially urbanized Santa Barbara watershed, estimates of water use and NPP that account for fine-scale impervious connection differed by more than 10% from those that did not.

Enhanced recovery efforts are generally focused on water and CO (sub 2) floods, or horizontal drilling, but the connectivity of the reefs laterally and vertically is poorly understood and unpredictable, leading to marginal success in many reefs. Niagaran ""pinnacle"" reef growth has previously been described as continuous growth during a single relative sea level rise. In this model, the characteristic shoaling upward sequence varies from a microbial mound facies at the base, with a stromatoporoid-dominated reef core capped by algal laminites and anhydrites that form a regional seal for many of the reefs in the Basin. Detailed core analysis within a sequence stratigraphic framework, however, indicates that the overall shoaling sequence is made up of higher frequency depositional cycles, each bounded by exposure or flooding surfaces. These tens of meters to meter scale cycles support an episodic reef growth model controlled by multiple fluctuations in relative sea level, and provides a means to predict reservoir quality since porosity and permeability is often related to primary facies in these reefs. Because many cycles contain reservoir facies bounded by low permeability units, the result is often significant vertical compartmentalization. This core-based understanding of the episodic nature of ""pinnacle"" reef growth, as well as the vertical facies successions and resulting impact on reservoir heterogeneity, should lead to enhanced predictability of reservoir architecture from wireline log signatures alone.","Sandomierski, Anthony;Grammer, G Michael;Harrison, William E;Anonymous",2006,"PG","LY","n","lake","y","pinnacle reef growth","unclear","y","probably wont be included in the end","pro_26",NA

Here, we show how lipid and growth can be used to evaluate hydrologic habitat preferences of fishes resilient to river fragmentation (i.e. species that can tolerate river fragmentation by dams, but not collapse). Lipid content was examined for seven fishes in a major southeastern USA reservoir and its largest lotic tributary over the 5 years. Controlling for effects of sex, size and year of collection, largemouth bass, spotted bass and black crappie had significantly higher lipid in lentic habitat. Conversely, channel catfish and freshwater drum had significantly higher lipid in lotic habitat. There were no significant differences in lipid of bluegill and blacktail shiner between hydrologic habitat types. Fish growth produced concordant results as largemouth bass and spotted bass had significantly faster growth in lentic habitat, whereas channel catfish and freshwater drum had significantly faster growth in lotic habitat. We were also able to document a synchronous spike in lipids of these species in both habitat types during a major drought. We surmise that the spike was driven by enhanced primary production, predator-prey concentration and possibly also reduced reproduction during intense drought. Two conclusions are drawn from this study as a whole. First, long-term lipid and growth observations hold promise for evaluating ecological effects of droughts over long time spans. Second, population characteristics are excellent indicators of habitat preferences and could be used more broadly to elucidate how organisms react to river ecosystem fragmentation and restoration initiatives.

"135","influences of multi-scale habitat on metabolism in a coastal great lakes watershed","Spatial heterogeneity influences ecosystem structure and function across multiple habitat scales. Although primary production and respiration are fundamental to energy cycling in aquatic ecosystems, we know relatively little about how habitat scale influences metabolism. In this study, we adopted a multi-scale habitat approach to evaluate primary production and respiration in a coastal Great Lakes watershed that is experiencing pressure from past, present, and anticipated future human activities. We divided the watershed into five macrohabitats (stream, river, wetland, drowned-river mouth lake, and Great Lake), two mesohabitats (benthic and water column), and four microhabitats (periphytic substrates: sand/sediment, rock, wood, and plant) for evaluation of spatial patterns and synchrony in metabolism. Factors that influenced patterns of metabolism were scale dependent. Algal biomass strongly influenced spatial patterns in metabolism at the meso- and microhabitat scales; greater algal biomass translated to higher areal-specific and lower chlorophyll-specific metabolism at benthic mesohabitat and sand/sediment and rock microhabitats. Benthic metabolism overwhelmed water column metabolism, irrespective of location or time of year. Watershed position was important at the macrohabitat scale, with greater overall metabolism in macrohabitats located lower in the watershed. Average synchrony in metabolism rates was greatest at the macrohabitat scale, suggesting metabolic patterns that are evident at finer scales may become integrated at coarser scales. Our results (1) show that spatial and temporal patterns in metabolism are shaped by factors that are dependent upon habitat scale; (2) highlight the importance of benthic productivity across habitat and season; and (3) suggest that hydrologic connectivity strongly influences ecosystem processes, although physical factors can affect these responses as evidenced by the low levels of synchrony between Lake Michigan and the other macrohabitats.","Ogdahl, Mary E;Lougheed, Vanessa L;Stevenson, RJan;Steinman, Alan D",2010,"PG","RP","n","stream, river, wetland, drowned-river mouth lake, and Great Lake","y","Algal biomass and metabolism","location","y",NA,"pro_40",NA
"136","linkages between hydrogeomorphology and nutrient availability in wetlands","Hydrogeomorphology is an important determinant of nutrient transport, cycling, and availability in wetlands. Fluvial geomorphic position in the landscape can influence the connectivity of wetlands to flowing water, thereby affecting the inputs of nutrients to the wetland, and ultimately controlling biogeochemical transformations. Similarly, internal geomorphic heterogeneity (microtopography) can influence soil wetness within the wetland and biogeochemistry. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs and soil biogeochemical transformations were measured across a range of wetland ecosystems, including floodplain wetlands, tidal freshwater wetlands, and created wetlands. Nitrogen and P inputs from sedimentation and inorganic ion loading to the soil surface were greater at locations with greater connectivity to river water. Nutrient inputs from sedimentation also vary across broad landscape gradients from nontidal, tidal freshwater, and tidal oligohaline wetlands. Both N and P mineralization in wetland soils increased with N and P inputs. Thus, greater hydrologic connectivity (as influenced by landscape position and river-wetland geomorphology) stimulates nutrient availability for primary production, other biogeochemical processes, and ecosystem nutrient retention. Furthermore, microtopographic heterogeneity within wetlands stimulated nutrient availability and retention. In tidal freshwater wetlands, hummocks were hotspots of soil nitrification relative to low lying hollows. In created wetlands, building microtopography during construction resulted in greater soil nitrification and denitrification. In conclusion, geomorphology and hydrology at multiple scales influence the inputs, biogeochemical transformations, and availability of nutrients in wetland ecosystems.","Noe, G B;Hupp, C R;Schenk, E;Batson, J;Krauss, K;Ensign, S;Wolf, K;Ahn, C;Anonymous",2013,"PG","CP","n","floodplain wetlands, tidal freshwater wetlands, and created wetlands","y","N and P"," landscape position and river-wetland geomorphology","y",NA,"pro_47",NA
"137","patterns of primary and heterotrophic productivity in an arid lowland river","Three river conceptual models make differing predictions about the major source of primary production in lowland rivers, acknowledging the importance of primary productivity in the ecology and management of lowland rivers. Patterns of primary production in lowland rivers are still an area of considerable uncertainty. The objective of this study was to examine the major sources and transformations of organic matter in an Australian lowland river and compare them to the predictions of existing models. The broad approach adopted was to quantify the contribution from the major ecosystem components and compare these with estimates of system metabolism determined using open water measures of diel oxygen change. Three 4-km river reaches were selected to represent the extent of variation found along the free-flowing lowland sections of the Murray River, one of Australia's largest and most regulated rivers. Annual open water gross primary production (GPP) estimates for the Murray R. during this study ranged from 221 to 376 gC m(-2) y(-1) and were similar to other large rivers. Examination of the net contribution of organic matter to the channel indicates that primary productivity in the Murray R. is derived from a combination of phytoplankton, riparian vegetation and macrophytes, but that the major source varies both spatially and temporally. The present study confirms that the River Continuum Concept (RCC), the Flood Pulse Concept (FPC) and Riverine Productivity Model (RPM) all have some application to Australian lowland rivers, but that synthesis of the models will be difficult until we can incorporate the extent, causes and consequences of primary production variability. This study also highlights the importance of the microbial loop and macrophytes in the ecology of the Murray R.

"138","soil bacterial diversity mediated by microscale aqueous-phase processes across biomes","Soil bacterial diversity varies across biomes with potential impacts on soil ecological functioning. Here, we incorporate key factors that affect soil bacterial abundance and diversity across spatial scales into a mechanistic modeling framework considering soil type, carbon inputs and climate towards predicting soil bacterial diversity. The soil aqueous-phase content and connectivity exert strong influence on bacterial diversity for each soil type and rainfall pattern. Biome-specific carbon inputs deduced from net primary productivity provide constraints on soil bacterial abundance independent from diversity. The proposed heuristic model captures observed global trends of bacterial diversity in good agreement with predictions by an individual-based mechanistic model. Bacterial diversity is highest at intermediate water contents where the aqueous phase forms numerous disconnected habitats and soil carrying capacity determines level of occupancy. The framework delineates global soil bacterial diversity hotspots; located mainly in climatic transition zones that are sensitive to potential climate and land use changes. Numerous micro- and macro-scale factors influence soil microbial diversity. Here the authors create a model to demonstrate that fine scale soil moisture influences the carrying capacity of microbes, which then scales up to larger biogeographic patterns.","Bickel, Samuel;Or Dani",2020,"PG","MB","n",NA,"y","soil bacterial abundance and diversity","water","n","soil moisture due to rainfall","pro_61","not aquatic"
"139","the impact of surface water exchange on the nutrient and particle dynamics in side-arms along the river danube, austria","Results of two monitoring programs obtained in the free-flowing section of the Danube downstream of Vienna were used to evaluate the effects of river restoration designed to increase surface water inputs into side-arms. Functional descriptors like hydrochemical parameters and plankton react immediately to restored hydrological conditions and offer the opportunity to elucidate the hydrological control on organic processing as an important ecosystem function in fluvial landscapes. Two hydraulic parameters were estimated and linked to basic ecological properties. The level of hydrological connectivity was defined as the average annual duration (days per year) of upstream surface connection and can be used as a 'simple to estimate' parameter within the planning phase. Water age, an adapted measure of residence time based on more detailed information, allow description of the temporal development in side-arms. Greater hydrological connectivity leads to lower conductivity levels and increased nutrient concentrations due to the shift of the dominating source to river water. The contribution of river flow is indicated by higher suspended solid concentrations in side-arms than disconnected water bodies. The phytoplankton biomass shows the highest mean values at a duration of integration of 1 month a super(-1) and decrease with increasing connectivity. The relationships point to a more 'main channel like' hydrochemical situation in the side-arms, with a medium level of phytoplankton biomass and increased autochthonous carbon export. No evidence of eutrophication was found due to the shift of the side-arm from an organic matter sink to a source. On a more detailed level, water age demonstrates the temporal patterns of riverine input, the development of plankton production and the shift between hydrological and biological control of phytoplankton vs. riverine flow in a side-arm. The hydrologic parameters were useful predictors for evaluating the effects of restoration measures in river floodplain systems.","Hein, T;Baranyi, C;Reckendorfer, W;Schiemer, F",2004,"PG","DC","n","river","y"," phytoplankton biomass, nutrient concentrations, conductivity, suspended sediments, water age ","average annual duration (days per year) of upstream surface connection","y",NA,"pro_68",NA
"140","use of ndvi and landscape metrics to assess effects of riverine inputs on wetland productivity and stability","Alterations to Louisiana's river systems and local hydrology have resulted in reduced freshwater, sediment, and nutrient inputs to wetland landscapes, causing significant negative impacts on marsh productivity and stability. This study set out to assess regional- and basin-scale impacts of river connectivity and sediment availability on wetland productivity. Satellite data were used in conjunction with river discharge, river sediment concentration, and wetland accretion data to evaluate correlations between river connectivity and wetland productivity and stability. Significant correlations were observed between river connectivity and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Aggregation Index (AI) values across a 10 year period of analysis. Moderate correlations (r(2) = 0.51) between mean NDVI and AI values were observed for all wetland vegetation in coastal Louisiana. Middle Coast wetlands had the highest river connectivity and significantly higher aboveground productivity, spatial integrity, and wetland area. The Chenier Plain, with moderate sediment and nutrient inputs, consisted primarily of moderate productivity and integrity. The majority of the inactive Deltaic Plain, which is largely sediment deprived, consists of landscapes with the lowest wetland productivity and spatial integrity. This study linked wetland area, configuration, and productivity with river connectivity to provide an enhanced understanding of river and sediment importance for wetland stability and restoration.","Suir, Glenn M.; Sasser, Charles E.",2019,"PG","DC","n","river and wetland","y","wetland accretion","Satellite data ","y","maybe be a unique response variable","pro_75",NA
"141","how do hydrogeological setting and meteorological conditions influence water table depth and fluctuations in ombrotrophic peatlands?","Peatlands are wetland ecosystems where net primary production exceeds organic matter decomposition. They are characterized by a near-surface water table controlled by a combination of internal and external processes, influenced by short-term meteorological and long-term climate variations among other factors. Site-specific conditions, such as peat hydrodynamic properties, surface vegetation patterns, and hydrogeological setting also substantially influence water table dynamics. The objective of this work was to characterize the influence of hydrogeological setting and meteorological conditions on water table depths (WTD) and on fluctuations therein in seven ombrotrophic peatlands in or near the St. Lawrence Lowlands (southern Quebec, Canada). Up-gradient, mid-gradient, and down-gradient locations were monitored in the seven peatlands, using dipwells with hourly WTD recordings. WTD was also monitored in the marginal minerotrophic zone found in three of the seven peatlands. Additionally, heads in the outflow (i.e., receiving diffused water from the peatland) and inflow (i.e., providing diffused water to the peatland) zones within the adjacent mineral deposits were monitored in seven and three peatlands respectively, using piezometers with hourly hydraulic head recordings. Hydraulic conductivities for the outflow zones ranged between 1.4*10(-7) and 8.5*10(-3) cm/s, whereas those of the inflow zones ranged between 5.6*10(-7) and 3.9*10(-6) cm/s. Evapotranspiration was shown to be the dominant factor controlling monthly cumulative water table decreases (MCD), while precipitation dominated the monthly cumulative water table increases (MCI). A strong correlation was found between mean peatland WTD and outflow zone hydraulic conductivity. Peatlands that were identified as being strongly connected with the adjacent mineral deposits in a diffuse underground outflow zone showed the greatest variations in water storage. This study highlights the importance of the connection between peatlands and adjacent mineral deposits in controlling WTD, as found for those located in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. The results show that water table fluctuations are strongly controlled by meteorological conditions, and that hydrogeological setting exerts a strong control on MCI and MCD. Moreover, this work shows that WTD in ombrotrophic peatlands is influenced by the hydraulic conductivity of the outflow zones, and confirms that aquifer - peatland connectivity influences peatland water storage variations, and therefore peatland vulnerability to disturbances in aquifer groundwater levels.","Bourgault, Marc-Andre; Larocque, Marie; Garneau, Michelle",2019,"check","PG","n","Peatlands","y","water table depths","hydraulic conductivity","n",NA,"pro_30","not aquatic"

Historically, emphasis was placed on upstream-downstream linkages in flowing waters, and theory (e.g, river continuum, nutrient spiraling) has evolved largely around this phenomenon However, other linkages among ecosystems have received increased attention in the past 20 y These linkages include surface-subsurface, lake-stream, river-floodplain, and, more recently, marine-freshwater.

"143","temperature and precipitation drive temporal variability in aquatic carbon and ghg concentrations and fluxes in a peatland catchment","The aquatic pathway is increasingly being recognized as an important component of catchment carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets, particularly in peatland systems due to their large carbon store and strong hydrological connectivity. In this study, we present a complete 5-year data set of all aquatic carbon and GHG species from an ombrotrophic Scottish peatland. Measured species include particulate and dissolved forms of organic carbon (POC, DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2, CH4 and N2O. We show that short-term variability in concentrations exists across all species and this is strongly linked to discharge. Seasonal cyclicity was only evident in DOC,CO2 and CH4 concentration; however, temperature correlated with monthly means in all species except DIC. Although the temperature correlation with monthly DOC and POC concentrations appeared to be related to biological productivity in the terrestrial system, we suggest the temperature correlation with CO2 and CH4 was primarily due to in-stream temperature-dependent solubility. Interannual variability in total aquatic carbon concentration was strongly correlated with catchment gross primary productivity (GPP) indicating a strong potential terrestrial aquatic linkage. DOC represented the largest aquatic carbon flux term (19.3 plus or minus 4.59 g C m-2 yr-1), followed by CO2 evasion (10.0 g C m-2 yr-1). Despite an estimated contribution to the total aquatic carbon flux of between 8 and 48%, evasion estimates had the greatest uncertainty. Interannual variability in total aquatic carbon export was low in comparison with variability in terrestrial biosphere-atmosphere exchange, and could be explained primarily by temperature and precipitation. Our results therefore suggest that climatic change is likely to have a significant impact on annual carbon losses through the aquatic pathway, and as such, aquatic exports are fundamental to the understanding of whole catchment responses to climate change.","Dinsmore, K J;Billett, M F;Dyson, KE",2013,"check","PG","n","Peatlands","y","particulate and dissolved forms of organic carbon (POC, DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2, CH4 and N2O","terrestrial aquatic linkage","n",NA,"pro_64","not aquatic"
"144","a vital link: water and vegetation in the anthropocene","This paper argues that the interplay of water, carbon and vegetation dynamics fundamentally links some global trends in the current and conceivable future Anthropocene, such as cropland expansion, freshwater use, and climate change and its impacts. Based on a review of recent literature including geographically explicit simulation studies with the process-based LPJmL global biosphere model, it demonstrates that the connectivity of water and vegetation dynamics is vital for water security, food security and (terrestrial) ecosystem dynamics alike. The water limitation of net primary production of both natural and agricultural plants - already pronounced in many regions - is shown to increase in many places under projected climate change, though this development is partially offset by water-saving direct CO sub(2) effects. Natural vegetation can to some degree adapt dynamically to higher water limitation, but agricultural crops usually require some form of active management to overcome it - among them irrigation, soil conservation and eventually shifts of cropland to areas that are less water-limited due to more favourable climatic conditions. While crucial to secure food production for a growing world population, such human interventions in water-vegetation systems have, as also shown, repercussions on the water cycle. Indeed, land use changes are shown to be the second-most important influence on the terrestrial water balance in recent times. Furthermore, climate change (warming and precipitation changes) will in many regions increase irrigation demand and decrease water availability, impeding rainfed and irrigated food production (if not CO sub(2) effects counterbalance this impact - which is unlikely at least in poorly managed systems). Drawing from these exemplary investigations, some research perspectives on how to further improve our knowledge of human-water-vegetation interactions in the Anthropocene are outlined.","Gerten, D",2013,"LY","MB","n","NA (terrestrial?)","n","net primary production (of terrestrial plants)",NA,"n",NA,"pro_3","type, connectivity"
"145","collapse and failure of ancient agricultural stone terraces: on-site geomorphic processes, pedogenic mechanisms, and soil quality","Water is the major limiting factor for primary productivity in drylands. In ancient times, stone terraces aimed at runoff harvesting and soil erosion control were established, allowing agricultural crop production. Land abandonment and cease of maintenance have led to the collapse and failure of terraces in the hinterlands of the Roman/Byzantine city of Avdat in the arid Negev Desert, Israel. The objective of this study was to assess the geomorphic processes and pedogenic mechanisms related to terrace collapse, and their on-site impact on soil quality. We studied key properties of the top 10 cm of soil in intact-terrace plots and partially-collapsed terrace plots, as well as in ‘natural’ lands. Unexpectedly, the soil texture was finer in the partially collapsed-terrace plots (clay loam) than that in the intact-terrace plots (loam). This was attributed to transportation of mineral material by rolling, which sorts out the large primary particles. This process, which characterizes rill erosion of high erosive power, is probably the predominant surface process in this study. The soil penetration resistance was significantly greater in the partially-collapsed terrace plots, and was attributed to the continuous removal of recently deposited loose sediments and exposure of the underlying, compacted older sediments. Soil stoniness, which was 16-fold greater in the partially-collapsed terrace plots, was also attributed to soil erosion. Unexpectedly, the total organic carbon was similar in both terrace states. Yet, labile organic carbon was 41% lower in soil of the partially-collapsed terrace plots, suggesting greater susceptibility of this fraction to erosional processes. The low electrical conductivity in the soil of the intact-terrace plots, was attributed to the better leaching of salts. The soil's calculated available water capacity was 42% greater in the intact-terrace plots. The study suggests that these processes and mechanisms strengthen each other through a chain of feedbacks, resulting in accelerated degradation of the collapsed-terrace lands.","Stavi, Ilan;Gusarov, Yulia;Halbac-Cotoara-Zamfir, Rares",2019,"LY","MB","n","NA (terrestrial?)","y","soil attributes and organic carbon",NA,"n",NA,"pro_10","connectivity"

While droughts receive much attention at lower latitudes, their effects on northern river networks remain unstudied. We combine a reach-scale manipulation experiment, observations during the extreme 2018 drought, and historical monitoring data to examine the impact of drought in northern boreal streams. Increased water residence time during drought promoted reductions in aerobic metabolism and increased concentrations of reduced solutes in both stream and hyporheic water. Likewise, data during the 2018 drought revealed widespread hypoxic conditions and shifts towards anaerobic metabolism, especially in headwaters. Finally, long-term data confirmed that past summer droughts have led to similar metabolic alterations. Our results highlight the potential for drought to promote biogeochemical shifts that trigger poor water quality conditions in boreal streams.

"147","effects of hydrologic connectivity on water chemistry, soils, and vegetation structure and function in an intermontane depressional wetland landscape","Historically, depressional wetlands have been viewed as small, closed basins without a naturally integrated inter-wetland surface drainage system. In this view, landscape-level connectivity is limited to surface water as overland flow. Contrasting with this view, conceptual prairie pothole ground-water models have relied on ground-water connectivity to explain inter-wetland differences in salinity, duration of inundation, and vegetation structure. To help clarify this contrast, we compared differences in hydrology, ground-water connectivity, near-surface soil moisture, geomorphology, water chemistry, and vegetation community structure and productivity for a suite of depressional wetlands in an intermontane prairie of western Montana. We compared depressional wetlands with and without temporary (< 4 wk) surface-water and/or soil-water connections. Connected wetlands had significantly smaller catchments, but stored more water, stored water longer, and had higher specific conductance than did isolated wetlands. Connected wetlands also had higher net primary productivity and a different plant community composition than did isolated wetlands. Comparisons of study site hydrology, water chemistry, and soil development found strong evidence for no ground-water exchange among any of the wetlands. The absence of ground water connection among these intermontane depressional wetlands emphasizes the importance of temporary surface-water and soil-water connections in depressional wetland ecology, as well as the need to understand the landscape scale variation of dissolved solutes and the distribution, abundance, and productivity of wetland plants among depressional wetlands and across wetland landscapes.","Cook, B J;Richard Hauer, F",2007,"LY","PG","n","wetlands","y","vegetative net primary productivity, among others","temporary (<4 wk) connected vs. not connected wetlands via surface and groundwater","y","temporary wetlands in intermontaine prairie","pro_24",NA

Over a 20-yr period of record, NO sub(3)-N removal averaged 118 kg N d super(-1) (0.77 g N m super(-2) d super(-1)) over the upper 5 km of the Ichetucknee River. Three independent estimates of gross autotrophicNassimilation (from gross primary production, diel NO sub(3) super(-) variation, and standing biomass) agreed closely but accounted for less than 20% of observed N removal. Longitudinal surveys indicate negligible or negative dissolved organic nitrogen and ammonium (NH sub(4) super(+)) production, suggesting that denitrification is the predominant mechanism of N removal in this river. A positive relationship between discharge and the magnitude of NO sub(3)-N removal shows that interactions with the surrounding floodplain exert considerable influence at high flows, and longitudinal NO sub(3) super(-) patterns indicate that N removal may be influenced by channel morphology. These results suggest a greater role for dissimilatory processes and hydrologic connectivity with hyporheic and floodplain sediments than has been previously recognized in highly productive spring-fed rivers of north Florida. While hydrologic variation is the primary determinant of variation in NO sub(3) super(-) removal within the Ichetucknee River, comparison across systems indicates that biotic characteristics can cause significant deviation from predictions based on purely physical models of relationships between river size and N removal.","Heffernan, James B;Cohen, Matthew J;Frazer, Thomas K;Thomas, Ray G;Rayfield, Travis J;Gulley, Jason;Martin, Jonathan B;Delfino, Joseph J;Graham, Wendy D",2010,"LY","MB","n","river-floodplain","y","forms of nitrogen (input and removal)","discharge","y",NA,"pro_31",NA
"149","incorporating ecological and evolutionary processes into continental-scale conservation planning","Systematic conservation planning research has focused on designing systems of conservation areas that efficiently protect a comprehensive and representative set of species and habitats. Recently, there has been an emphasis on improving the adequacy of conservation area design to promote the persistence and future generation of biodiversity. Few studies have explored incorporating ecological and evolutionary processes into conservation planning assessments. Biodiversity in Australia is maintained and generated by numerous ecological and evolutionary processes at various spatial and temporal scales. We accommodated ecological and evolutionary processes in four ways: ( 1) using sub-catchments as planning units to facilitate the protection of the integrity and function of ecosystem processes occurring on a sub-catchment scale; ( 2) targeting one type of ecological refugia, drought refugia, which are critical for the persistence of many species during widespread drought; ( 3) targeting one type of evolutionary refugia which are important for maintaining and generating unique biota during long-term climatic changes; and ( 4) preferentially grouping priority areas along vegetated waterways to account for the importance of connected waterways and associated riparian areas in maintaining processes. We identified drought refugia, areas of relatively high and regular herbage production in arid and semiarid Australia, from estimates of gross primary productivity derived from satellite data. In this paper, we combined the novel incorporation of these processes with a more traditional framework of efficiently representing a comprehensive sample of biodiversity to identify spatial priorities across Australia. We explored the trade-offs between economic costs, representation targets, and connectivity. Priority areas that considered ecological and evolutionary processes were more connected along vegetated waterways and were identified for a small increase in economic cost. Priority areas for conservation investment are more likely to have long-term benefits to biodiversity if ecological and evolutionary processes are considered in their identification.","Klein, Carissa; Wilson, Kerrie; Watts, Matthew; Stein, Janet; Berry, Sandra; Carwardine, Josie; Smith, Mark Stafford; Mackey, Brendan; Possingham, Hugh P.",2009,"LY","DC","n","all?","y","biodiversity","vegetated waterways","y","satellite imagery analysis at landscape scale for conservation planning","pro_38",NA

We expected that nitrate concentrations in surface water and groundwater would be higher on flow paths below alder. We further expected that nitrate concentrations would be higher in surface water and groundwater at the base of short flow paths with alder and that streamside wetlands at the base of alder‐near flow paths would be less nitrogen limited than wetlands at the base of long flow paths with alder. Our results showed that groundwater nitrate‐N concentrations were significantly higher at alder‐near sites than at no‐alder sites, but did not differ significantly between alder‐far sites and no‐alder sites or between alder‐far sites and alder‐near sites. A survey of 15 N stable isotope signatures in soils and foliage in alder‐near and no‐alder flow paths indicated the alder‐derived nitrogen evident in soils below alder is quickly integrated downslope. Additionally, there was a significant difference in the relative increase in plant biomass after nitrogen fertilization, with the greatest increase occurring in the no‐alder sites. This study demonstrates that streamside wetlands and streams are connected to the surrounding landscapes through hydrologic flow paths, and flow paths with alder stands are potential “hot spots” for nitrogen subsidies at the hillslope scale.","Callahan, Michael K;Whigham, Dennis F;Rains, Mark C;Rains, Kai C;King, Ryan S;Walker, Coowe M;Maurer, Jasmine R;Baird, Steven J",2017,"LY","DC","n","wetlands, streams","y","nitrate, plant biomass","upslope/downslope flow paths between streams/wetlands and alders","y","looking at nitrogen-fixation by alders ","pro_52",""

Climate change projections show increased drought severity in drylands that could compromise wetland resilience and reduce important habitat services. These recognized risks have been difficult to evaluate due to our limited capacity to establish comprehensive relationships between flood-drought episodes and vegetation responses at the relevant spatiotemporal scales. We address this issue by integrating detailed spatiotemporal flood-drought simulations with remotely sensed vegetation responses to water regimes in a dryland wetland known for its highly variable inundation. We show that a combination of drought tolerance and dormancy strategies allow wetland vegetation to recover after droughts and recolonize areas invaded by terrestrial species. However, climate change scenarios show widespread degradation during drought and limited recovery after floods. Importantly, the combination of degradation extent and increase in drought duration is critical for the habitat services wetland systems provide for waterbirds and fish.","Sandi, Steven G;Rodriguez, Jose F;Saintilan, Neil;Wen, Li;Kuczera, George;Riccardi, Gerardo;Saco, Patricia M",2020,"LY","DC","n","dryland wetland","y","vegetation (from remote sensing)","inundated/not inundated","y","flood-drought simulations for climate change","pro_59",NA
"153","the danube restoration project: functional aspects and planktonic productivity in the floodplain system","In Austria, the 'Danube Restoration Project' (DRP) was implemented to re-establish the connectivity between the Danube and its floodplain along a free flowing section downstream of Vienna. Before the restoration, the status quo of the 'Regelsbrunn' floodplain segment was investigated at different levels of abiotic, biotic and functional properties according to the spatio-temporal effects of hydrological connectivity. The present paper deals with temporal effects on hydrochemistry and on phyto- and bacterioplankton in the side channel (parapotamon). A hydrological situation of the present state of short-termed and intensive flood pulses followed by a period of isolation was compared with a period of higher connectivity reflecting the situation after the restoration. Rising water levels in the river, establishing local surface inflows, resulted in periodic nutrient pulses, high particle load and eutrophication in the floodplain. With disconnection after a spate, the nitrate and soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) concentration decreased significantly during 1 month. Phytoplankton correlated negatively with SRP during the first week after a flood pulse, reflecting the dominance of phytoplankton in SRP uptake. Planktonic primary production was stimulated by the nutrient import at higher connectivity and could be controlled by a decrease in retention time, related to the aims of the DRP. The two investigated periods indicated that increasing retention time in the side channel resulted in a shift from primary production towards prevailing bacterial secondary production.","Hein, T.; Heiler, G.; Pennetzdorfer, D.; Riedler, P.; Schagerl, M.; Schiemer, F.",1999,"LY","ES","n","river-floodplain","y","hydrochemistry, phytoplankton, bacterioplankton","higher connectivity vs. flood-isolation","y","found shift from primary production to secondary bacterial production with increased retention time due to nutrient pulses (after restoration?)","pro_66",""

Additionally, we evaluated the 'outwelling hypothesis', which hypothesizes that mangrove-derived detritus exported to the adjacent marine area is a food source for marine macroconsumers at open and reef-protected sandy beaches. Primary producers and macroconsumers (62 and 214 samples, respectively) were collected at five locations across the main longitudinal axis of the Mamanguape estuary, a tropical Southwestern Atlantic estuary. There were marked shifts in carbon and nitrogen isotope values for both food sources and consumers along the estuarine-marine gradient, and the mixing model results revealed similar patterns of assimilation of basal food sources by decapod crustaceans and fishes. In the inner section of the estuary, consumers tended to assimilated nutrients derived mainly from mangrove and macroalgae, whereas nearer the mouth of the estuary and in the adjacent marine area they assimilated nutrients derived mainly from macroalgae, seagrass and organic matter in the sediment (SOM). These findings support the hypothesis that the relative importance of basal food sources to macroconsumers in this tropical estuarine system reflects the dominant autochthonous primary production at each location. In contrast, our results did not support the outwelling hypothesis that mangrove-originated detritus, in the form of senescent mangrove leaves, makes a significant contribution as a primary source of carbon to high-order consumers inhabiting adjacent ocean sandy beaches.","Claudino, Marlucy Coelho;Pessanha, Andre Luiz Machado;Araujo, Francisco Gerson;Garcia, Alexandre Miranda",2015,"LY","DC","y","marine","y","basal food sources (detritus, macroalgae, etc)","isotope signatures ","n",NA,"pro_73","marine"
"155","refining the 'pulse-reserve' model for arid central australia: seasonal rainfall, soil moisture and plant productivity in sand ridge and stony plain habitats of the simpson desert","In dry ecosystems, water supply is highly variable in time and space, occurring either as short pulses of shallow soil water or long phases of deep soil water. There may be correspondence between hierarchical soil water pulses and hierarchical biological responses, but this has not been directly tested for arid Australia. We compared plant community responses to an isolated short rain pulse (about 130mm, November 2008) versus the start, mid and later stages of an extended high rainfall phase (about 540mm, February 2010 to March 2011) at a site on the western edge of the Simpson Desert. We sampled across contrasting habitats: tall longitudinal sand ridges and adjacent stony clay plains (gibber). Thus, we compared responses to spatially variable soil moisture availability (sand vs. clay soil; run-off/on relief) and temporally variable rainfall supply. Our results supported the hierarchical resource pulse-biological response concept for dry ecosystems, with the short and long rainfall phases modulating distinct responses among functional types. Shallow-rooted annual grasses showed an equivalent positive response to the isolated pulse as to the first pulse of the high rain phase; whereas short-lived forbs, longer-lived (2-3 years) grasses and persistent forbs had peak abundance during the high rainfall phase. Perennial grass and shrub productivity did not change over time, though there was a distinct trend towards heightened sexual reproduction at the mid-late stages of the high rain phase. We also found that species seasonal growth tendencies were pronounced, and that spatial aspects of moisture availability resulted in different composition patterns at the habitat scale with the gibber and sand ridge sites showing strong and weak correspondence with temporal rainfall patterning respectively. Thus, we confirm that plant productivity models for this region should include the effects of rainfall connectivity and soil texture as well as species seasonal growth constraints and rooting attributes.","Nano, Catherine E.

Hydrologic conditions in the river determine whether oxbows are isolated or connected with the river. They also determine the time and duration of both phases. The studied oxbow lake, located in the floodplain of the lower Vistula, was created as the result of river regulation in the 19th century.

The study was aimed at evaluating the impact of changes in the river level on the oxbow lake. Potamophase brought greater zooplankton diversity. We recorded a higher number of species and a higher Shannon diversity index ( H ′). During limnophase, higher water temperature led to greater zooplankton density. However, its diversity decreased. In recent years, probably due to climate change, the amount of precipitation has decreased. As a result, water levels in rivers are lower and potamophase is rare, while periods of isolation are longer.

Such effects may be exacerbated by increased inter-specific competition if climate alters species dominance where competitor ranges overlap. This study used census data, telemetry and stable isotopes to examine the population and foraging ecology of a pair of Arctic and temperate congeners across an extensive zone of sympatry in Iceland, where sea temperatures varied substantially. The abundance of Arctic BrÃ¼nnich's guillemot Uria lomvia declined with sea temperature. Accessibility of refugia in cold water currents or fjords helped support higher numbers and reduce rates of population decline. Competition with temperate Common guillemots Uria aalge did not affect abundance, but similarities in foraging ecology were sufficient to cause competition when resources are limiting.

"159","disturbance legacies increase and synchronize nutrient concentrations and bacterial productivity in coastal ecosystems","Long-term ecological research can resolve effects of disturbance on ecosystem dynamics by capturing the scale of disturbance and interactions with environmental changes. To quantify how disturbances interact with long-term directional changes (sea-level rise, freshwater restoration), we studied 17 yr of monthly dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and phosphorus (TP) concentrations and bacterioplankton productivity across freshwater-to-marine estuary gradients exposed to multiple disturbance events (e.g., droughts, fire, hurricanes, and low-temperature anomalies) and long-term increases in water levels. By studying two neighboring drainages that differ in hydrologic connectivity, we additionally tested how disturbance legacies are shaped by hydrologic connectivity. We predicted that disturbance events would interact with long-term increases in water levels in freshwater and marine ecosystems to increase spatiotemporal similarity (i.e., synchrony) of organic matter, nutrients, and microbial activities. Wetlands along the larger, deeper, and tidally influenced Shark River Slough (SRS) drainage had higher and more variable DOC, TN, and TP concentrations than wetlands along the smaller, shallower, tidally restricted Taylor River Slough/Panhandle (TS/Ph) drainage. Along SRS, DOC concentrations declined with proximity to coast, and increased in magnitude and variability following drought and flooding in 2015 and a hurricane in 2017. Along TS/Ph, DOC concentrations varied by site (higher in marine than freshwater wetlands) but not year. In both drainages, increases in TN from upstream freshwater marshes occurred following fire in 2008 and droughts in 2010 and 2015, whereas downstream increases in TP occurred with coastal storm surge from hurricanes in 2005 and 2017. Decreases in DOC:TN and DOC:TP were explained by increased TN and TP. Increases in bacterioplankton productivity occurred throughout both drainages following low-temperature events (2010 and 2011) and a hurricane (2017). Long-term TN and TP concentrations and bacterioplankton productivity were correlated (r > 0.5) across a range of sampling distances (1-50 km), indicating spatiotemporal synchrony. DOC concentrations were not synchronized across space or time. Our study advances disturbance ecology theory by illustrating how disturbance events interact with long-term environmental changes and hydrologic connectivity to determine the magnitude and extent of disturbance legacies.

"160","effects and prediction of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of aquatic food webs","Nonpoint source pollution entering rivers will pollute water quality, degrading the health of aquatic ecosystems. However, owing to the lack of quantitative research on the effects of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of aquatic food webs, there is a lack of quantitative basis for river management. Nonpoint source pollution is not only difficult to control effectively, but also the success rate of water ecological restoration projects is low. With the increasing proportion of nonpoint source pollution in water environmental problems, it is urgent to quantitatively assess and predict the impact of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of food webs. Therefore, this thesis presents a method for quantitatively assessing and predicting the impact of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of food webs through using fuzzy clustering to screen the typical points of the impact of nonpoint source pollution, then using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and partial least squares regression analysis to comprehensively filtrate the driving factors affect food web that results in nonpoint source pollution, and then determining the impact of each driving factor on the structure of food webs. Finally, the change trend of food web structure is predicted. The results show that (1) the driving factors that the nonpoint source pollution that affects the food web structure is NH 3 â€N and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The increase in NH 3 â€N and COD promotes the growth of phytoplankton, causing the change of the primary productivity of the ecosystem, and ultimately changes the entire food web structure; (2) NH 3 â€N and COD affect the stability, maturity, connectivity and complexity of the aquatic food web structure. The increase of NH 3 â€N increases the connectivity and maturity of the food web structure but reduces complexity and stability; the increase of COD increases the connection of the food web structure, while reducing the other three indicators; (3) in some areas with good water quality, aquatic species diversity is high, the relationship of interspecies dietary is complex, food web structure level index is high and the structure of food web is stable. The food web structure in the rainy season will be better than that in the dry season. In some areas with severe water pollution and poor food web structure, the ability of the food web to resist external interference is weak. The food web structure in the rainy season will be worse than that in the dry season owing to rainfall into the river. The methods and conclusions in this treatise can provide a reliable and quantitative scientific basis for river ecosystem management and ecosystem restoration and can improve the success rate of ecological restoration projects.","Zhao, Chang S;Pan, Xu;Yang, Sheng T;Xiang, Hua;Zhao, Jin;Gan, Xin J;Ding, Su Y;Yu, Qiang",2021,"CP","DC","n","river","y","primary productivity; compexity of food web structure; change trend of food webs","connectivity of aquatic food web structure?","n","not about hydrologic connectivity, though could have useful info about food webs and nutrients/rain","pro_23","connectivity"
"161","how do hydrogeological setting and meteorological conditions influence water table depth and fluctuations in ombrotrophic peatlands?","Peatlands are wetland ecosystems where net primary production exceeds organic matter decomposition. They are characterized by a near-surface water table controlled by a combination of internal and external processes, influenced by short-term meteorological and long-term climate variations among other factors. Site-specific conditions, such as peat hydrodynamic properties, surface vegetation patterns, and hydrogeological setting also substantially influence water table dynamics. The objective of this work was to characterize the influence of hydrogeological setting and meteorological conditions on water table depths (WTD) and on fluctuations therein in seven ombrotrophic peatlands in or near the St. Lawrence Lowlands (southern Quebec, Canada). Up-gradient, mid-gradient, and down-gradient locations were monitored in the seven peatlands, using dipwells with hourly WTD recordings. WTD was also monitored in the marginal minerotrophic zone found in three of the seven peatlands. Additionally, heads in the outflow (i.e., receiving diffused water from the peatland) and inflow (i.e., providing diffused water to the peatland) zones within the adjacent mineral deposits were monitored in seven and three peatlands respectively, using piezometers with hourly hydraulic head recordings. Hydraulic conductivities for the outflow zones ranged between 1.4*10(-7) and 8.5*10(-3) cm/s, whereas those of the inflow zones ranged between 5.6*10(-7) and 3.9*10(-6) cm/s. Evapotranspiration was shown to be the dominant factor controlling monthly cumulative water table decreases (MCD), while precipitation dominated the monthly cumulative water table increases (MCI). A strong correlation was found between mean peatland WTD and outflow zone hydraulic conductivity. Peatlands that were identified as being strongly connected with the adjacent mineral deposits in a diffuse underground outflow zone showed the greatest variations in water storage. This study highlights the importance of the connection between peatlands and adjacent mineral deposits in controlling WTD, as found for those located in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. The results show that water table fluctuations are strongly controlled by meteorological conditions, and that hydrogeological setting exerts a strong control on MCI and MCD. Moreover, this work shows that WTD in ombrotrophic peatlands is influenced by the hydraulic conductivity of the outflow zones, and confirms that aquifer - peatland connectivity influences peatland water storage variations, and therefore peatland vulnerability to disturbances in aquifer groundwater levels.","Bourgault, Marc-Andre; Larocque, Marie; Garneau, Michelle",2019,"CP","PG","n","peatlands","y","water table depth","peatland connected with mineral deposits in underground oiutflow zone","n","connectivity type","pro_30","connectivity"
"162","ideas and perspectives: carbon leaks from flooded land: do we need to replumb the inland water active pipe?","At the global scale, inland waters are a significant source of atmospheric carbon (C), particularly in the tropics. The active pipe concept predicts that C emissions from streams, lakes and rivers are largely fuelled by terrestrial ecosystems. The traditionally recognized C transfer mechanisms from terrestrial to aquatic systems are surface runoff and groundwater drainage. We present here a series of arguments that support the idea that land flooding is an additional significant process that fuels inland waters with C at the global scale. Whether the majority of CO 2 emitted by rivers comes from floodable land (approximately 10 % of the continents) or from well-drained land is a fundamental question that impacts our capacity to predict how these C fluxes might change in the future. Using classical concepts in ecology, we propose, as a necessary step forward, an update of the active pipe concept that differentiates floodable land from drained land. Contrarily to well-drained land, many wetlands (in particular riparian and littoral wetlands) combine strong hydrological connectivity with inland waters, high productivity assimilating CO 2 from the atmosphere, direct transfer of litter and exudation products to water and waterlogged soils, a generally dominant allocation of ecosystem respiration (ER) below the water surface and a slow gas-exchange rate at the waterâ€“air interface. These properties force plants to pump atmospheric C to wetland waters and, when hydrology is favourable, to inland waters as organic C and dissolved CO 2 . This wetland CO 2 pump may contribute disproportionately to CO 2 emissions from inland waters, particularly in the tropics where 80 % of the global CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere occur. In future studies, more care must be taken in the way that vertical and horizontal C fluxes are conceptualized along watersheds, and 2-D models that adequately account for the hydrological export of all C species are necessary. In flooded ecosystems, significant effort should be dedicated to quantifying the components of primary production and respiration by the submerged and emerged part of the ecosystem community and to using these metabolic rates in coupled hydrologicalâ€“biogeochemical models. The construction of a global typology of wetlands that includes productivity, gas fluxes and hydrological connectivity with inland waters also appears necessary to adequately integrate continental C fluxes at the global scale.","Abril, GwenaÃ«l;Borges, Alberto V",2019,"CP","RP","n","wetlands","n","carbon transfer","connectivity with inland waters","n","theory proposal, not original research","pro_37","type"

"164","management options for restoring estuarine dynamics and implications for ecosystems: a quantitative approach for the southwest delta in the netherlands","The Delta Works, a series of dams and barriers constructed in the 1960's-1980's changed the estuarine landscape of the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta (SW Netherlands) into more stagnant and disengaged freshwater, brackish water or saltwater lakes. The remaining tidal systems were adapted by building a storm surge barrier in the Oosterschelde and dike reinforcement works along the Westerschelde. The Delta Works brought protection against flooding, but at the same time resulted in environmental and socio-economic problems, such as degradation of ecological quality and ecosystem functioning, disruption of fish migration routes, water and sediment quality problems. In this study we explore in an integrated, quantitative way the consequences of a number of management options for the Southwest Delta and their implications for the occurrence and distribution of aquatic and estuarine habitats, considering the mutual coherence between the water basins. Five scenarios were evaluated using a 1D hydraulic, water quality and primary production numerical model and GIS habitat mapping. Scenarios vary from small-scale interventions, such as changes in day-to-day management of hydraulic infrastructures or creation of small inlets in dams, feasible in the short term, to restoration of an open delta by removing dams and barriers, as a long term potential. We evaluate the outcomes in relation to the restoration of estuarine dynamics, as this is in policy plans proposed as a generic solution for the current ecological and environmental problems. Net water flow rates show more complex patterns when connectivity between water basins is increased and when sluice management is less strict. Estuarine transition zones and fish migration routes are partly restored, but only fully develop when basins are in open connection with each other. Area of intertidal habitats, tidal flats and tidal marshes, increases in each scenario, ranging between 7 and 83%, 1-56%, and 8-100% respectively, depending on scenario. Large scale infrastructural adaptations are needed to restore estuarine dynamics at large scale. The use of a 1D numerical model allowed to quantify the effect of different management measures for all water basins simultaneously, but also has its limitations. The model does not resolve more complex processes such as vertical mixing and morphodynamic changes. This requires expert judgment and more detailed 3D modelling. (C) 2015 The Authors.

"166","the 'wet-dry' in the wet-dry tropics drives river ecosystem structure and processes in northern australia","1. Northern Australia is characterised by a tropical wet-dry climate that regulates the distinctive character of river flow regimes across the region. There is marked hydrological seasonality, with most flow occurring over only a few months of the year during the wet season. Flow is also characterised by high variability between years, and in the degree of flow cessation, or intermittency, over the dry season.2. At present, the relatively low human population density and demand for water in the region means that most rivers have largely unmodified flow regimes. These rivers therefore provide a good opportunity to understand the role of natural flow variability in river ecosystem structure and processes.3. This review describes the major flow regime classes characterising northern Australian rivers, from perennial to seasonally intermittent to extremely intermittent, and how these regimes give rise to marked differences in the ecological character of these tropical rivers, particularly their floodplains.4. We describe the key features of these flow regimes, namely the wet and dry seasons and the transitions between these seasons, and how they regulate the biophysical heterogeneity, primary productivity and movement of biota in Australia's wet-dry tropical rivers.5.

"167","trends in a satellite-derived vegetation index and environmental variables in a restored brackish lagoon","We evaluated relative influence of climatic variables on the plant productivity after lagoon restoration. Chilika Lagoon, the largest brackish lake ecosystem in East Asia, experienced severe problems such as excessive dominance of freshwater exotic plants and rapid debasement of biodiversity associated with decreased hydrologic connectivity between the lagoon and the ocean. To halt the degradation of the lagoon ecosystem, the Chilika Development Authority implemented a restoration project, creating a new channel to penetrate the barrier beach of the lagoon. Using a satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset, we compared the trend of vegetation changes after the lagoon restoration, from April 1998 to May 2014. The time series of NDVI data were decomposed into trend, seasonal, and random components using a local regression method. The results were visualized to understand the traits of spatial distribution in the lagoon. The NDVI trend, indicative of primary productivity, decreased rapidly during the restoration period, and gradually increased (slope coefficient: 2.1Ã—10âˆ’4, p&lt;0.05) after two years of restoration. Level of seawater exchange had more influences on plant productivity than local precipitation in the restored lagoon. Higher El NinÌƒo/Southern Oscillation increased sea level pressure, and caused intrusion of seawater into the lagoon, and the subsequently elevated salinity decreased the annual mean NDVI. Our findings suggest that lagoon restoration plans for enhancing interconnectivity with the ocean should consider oceanographic effects due to meteorological forcing, and long-term NDVI results can be used as a valuable index for adaptive management of the restoration site.","Kim, Ji Yoon;Pattnaik, Ajit K;Dong-Kyun, Kim;Gea-Jae Joo;Rastogi, Gurdeep;Muduli, Pradipta R;Samal, Rabindra N;Do, Yuno",2015,"CP","ES","y","lagoon","y","vegetation change","ocean-lagoon; level of seawater exchange","n","marine connectivity","pro_72","marine"
"168","dam builders and their works; beaver influences on the structure and function of river corridor hydrology, geomorphology, biogeochemistry and ecosystems","Beavers (Castor fiber, Castor canadensis) are one of the most influential mammalian ecosystem engineers, heavily modifying river corridor hydrology, geomorphology, nutrient cycling, and ecosystems. As an agent of disturbance, they achieve this first and foremost through dam construction, which impounds flow and increases the extent of open water, and from which all other landscape and ecosystem impacts follow. After a long period of local and regional eradication, beaver populations have been recovering and expanding throughout Europe and North America, as well as an introduced species in South America, prompting a need to comprehensively review the current state of knowledge on how beavers influence the structure and function of river corridors. Here, we synthesize the overall impacts on hydrology, geomorphology, biogeochemistry, and aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Our key findings are that a complex of beaver dams can increase surface and subsurface water storage, modify the reach scale partitioning of water budgets, allow site specific flood attenuation, alter low flow hydrology, increase evaporation, increase water and nutrient residence times, increase geomorphic heterogeneity, delay sediment transport, increase carbon, nutrient and sediment storage, expand the extent of anaerobic conditions and interfaces, increase the downstream export of dissolved organic carbon and ammonium, decrease the downstream export of nitrate, increase lotic to lentic habitat transitions and aquatic primary production, induce 'reverse' succession in riparian vegetation assemblages, and increase habitat complexity and biodiversity on reach scales. We then examine the key feedbacks and overlaps between these changes caused by beavers, where the decrease in longitudinal hydrologic connectivity create ponds and wetlands, transitions between lentic to lotic ecosystems, increase vertical hydraulic exchange gradients, and biogeochemical cycling per unit stream length, while increased lateral connectivity will determine the extent of open water area and wetland and littoral zone habitats, and induce changes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem assemblages. However, the extent of these impacts depends firstly on the hydro-geomorphic landscape context, which determines the extent of floodplain inundation, a key driver of subsequent changes to hydrologic, geomorphic, biogeochemical, and ecosystem dynamics. Secondly, it depends on the length of time beavers can sustain disturbance at a given site, which is constrained by top down (e.g. predation) and bottom up (e.g. competition) feedbacks, and ultimately determines the pathways of river corridor landscape and ecosystem succession following beaver abandonment. This outsized influence of beavers on river corridor processes and feedbacks is also fundamentally distinct from what occurs in their absence. Current river management and restoration practices are therefore open to re-examination in order to account for the impacts of beavers, both positive and negative, such that they can potentially accommodate and enhance the ecosystem engineering services they provide. It is hoped that our synthesis and holistic framework for evaluating beaver impacts can be used in this endeavor by river scientists and managers into the future as beaver populations continue to expand in both numbers and range.","Larsen, Annegret;Larsen, Joshua R;Lane, Stuart N",2021,"check","CP","n","river","u","hydrology, geomorphology, residence times of nutrients and water, water quality, type of primary production, habitat complexity, biodiversity","beaver dams; longitudinal connectivity and lateral connectivity","n","synthesis; no stats discussed","pro_13","type"
"169","continental-scale consequences of tree die-offs in north america: identifying where forest loss matters most","Regional-scale tree die-off events driven by drought and warming and associated pests and pathogens have occurred recently on all forested continents and are projected to increase in frequency and extent with future warming. Within areas where tree mortality has occurred, ecological, hydrological and meteorological consequences are increasingly being documented. However, the potential for tree die-off to impact vegetation processes and related carbon dynamics in areas remote to where die-off occurs has rarely been systematically evaluated, particularly for multiple distinct regions within a given continent. Such remote impacts can occur when climate effects of local vegetation change are propagated by atmospheric circulationâ€”the phenomena of â€˜ecoclimate teleconnectionsâ€™. We simulated tree die-off events in the 13 most densely forested US regions (selected from the 20 US National Ecological Observatory Network [NEON] domains) and found that tree die-off even for smaller regions has potential to affect climate and hence Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) in disparate regions (NEON domains), either positively or negatively. Some regions exhibited strong teleconnections to several others, and some regions were relatively sensitive to tree loss regardless of what other region the tree loss occurred in. For the US as a whole, loss of trees in the Pacific Southwestâ€”an area undergoing rapid tree die-offâ€”had the largest negative impact on remote US GPP whereas loss of trees in the Mid-Atlantic had the largest positive impact. This research lays a foundation for hypotheses that identify how the effects of tree die-off (or other types of tree loss such as deforestation) can ricochet across regions by revealing hot-spots of forcing and response. Such modes of connectivity have direct applicability for improving models of climate change impacts and for developing more informed and coordinated carbon accounting across regions.","Swann, Abigail L S;LaguÃ«, Marysa M;Garcia, Elizabeth S;Field, Jason P;Breshears, David D;Moore, David J P;Saleska, Scott R;Stark, Scott C;Juan Camilo Villegas;Law, Darin J;Minor, David M",2018,"check","CP","n","land","y","US GPP","tree die-off connectivity","n","simulations; land; connectivity type","pro_12","connectivity"
"170","landscape ecology: a framework for integrating pattern and process in river corridors","Investigations of European floodplain rivers demonstrate how landscape ecology can provide an effective framework to integrate pattern and process in river corridors, to examine environmental dynamics and interactive pathways between landscape elements, and to develop viable strategies for river conservation. The highly complex and dynamic nature of intact river corridors is particularly amenable to a landscape ecology perspective. Analysis of spatial patterns has provided considerable insight into environmental heterogeneity across river corridors and is an essential prelude to examining dynamic interactions. For example, data from aerial photographs, digitized maps and year-round field measurements in a glacial flood plain, enabled us to distinguish six channel types, based on the correspondence between connectivity and physicochemical attributes. Spatial data were also used to analyze longitudinal changes in landscape elements along the course of a morphologically-intact riverine corridor, providing insight into the structural complexity that must have characterized many Alpine rivers in the pristine state. Landscape indices were employed to investigate seasonal dynamics in a glacial flood plain of the Swiss Alps which exhibits a predictable expansion/contraction cycle, with corresponding shifts in flow paths (surface and subsurface) and water sources (snowmelt, englacial, subglacial, alluvial aquifer, hillslope aquifer). Surface connectivity exhibited an unexpected biphasic relationship with total channel length, whereas riverscape diversity progressively increased along the entire range of channel length. Reconstituting the functional integrity that characterizes intact river corridors should perhaps be the major goal of river conservation initiatives. Although understanding functional processes at the landscape scale is essential in this regard, few data are available. In the Alluvial Zone National Park on the Austrian Danube, three phases of hydrological connectivity were identified (disconnection, seepage connection and surface connection) that corresponded to the predominance of three functional processes (biotic interactions, primary production and particulate transport) within the river corridor.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","Ward, J V;Malard, Florian;Tockner, Klement",2002,"check","CP","n","rivers","y","biotic interactions, primary production, particulate transport","surface connectivity, hydrological connectivity (disconnection, seepage, surface) ","y","","pro_43",NA
"171","biogeochemistry and biodiversity in a network of saline–alkaline lakes: implications of ecohydrological connectivity in the kenyan rift valley","The volcanic and tectonic lakes of the eastern branch of the African Great Rift Valley are exposed to multiple stressors and characterised by different levels of hydrological connectivity. Past volcanic activity generated endorheic basins, in which the nature of the bedrock, its connection with groundwater, and local climatic conditions, favoured the formation of highly alkaline soda waters. While little is known about their nutrient dynamics, most lakes in this area experience considerable microbial blooms and harbour diverse and specifically adapted microbial populations, some of which could embody novel biotechnological potential.Here we review the geochemical and (micro)biological features of a cluster of lakes distributed within the East African Rift, ranging from fresh to hypersaline, under different levels of hydrological connectivity. Possibly no other location on Earth has a comparable range of lake types in close proximity to each other and representing such a remarkable microbial biodiversity. Environmental heterogeneity and habitat connectivity among adjacent aquatic ecosystems may have positive implications in terms of regional environmental stability by enhancing the overall carrying capacity, i.e. the resilience to various forms of impact, contributing to biodiversity protection.Within these ecosystems, microbial processes encompass the entire basis of their primary production, in particular those driven by cyanobacteria. Combining a multi-disciplinary ecohydrological approach with a biogeochemical investigation of the principles underlying their functioning, our study can contribute to the development of appropriate environmental protection measures to effectively maintain their natural capital.","Fazi, Stefano;Butturini, Andrea;Tassi, Franco;Amalfitano, Stefano;Venturi, Stefania;Vazquez, Eusebi;Clokie, Martha;Wanjala, Silas W;Pacini, Nic;Harper, David M",2018,"ES","RP","n","lake","y","geochemical and microbiological features","unclear, hydrology or subterranean geothermal processes?","n","full text needed","pro_6","connectivity"
"172","dam builders and their works; beaver influences on the structure and function of river corridor hydrology, geomorphology, biogeochemistry and ecosystems","Beavers (Castor fiber, Castor canadensis) are one of the most influential mammalian ecosystem engineers, heavily modifying river corridor hydrology, geomorphology, nutrient cycling, and ecosystems. As an agent of disturbance, they achieve this first and foremost through dam construction, which impounds flow and increases the extent of open water, and from which all other landscape and ecosystem impacts follow. After a long period of local and regional eradication, beaver populations have been recovering and expanding throughout Europe and North America, as well as an introduced species in South America, prompting a need to comprehensively review the current state of knowledge on how beavers influence the structure and function of river corridors. Here, we synthesize the overall impacts on hydrology, geomorphology, biogeochemistry, and aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Our key findings are that a complex of beaver dams can increase surface and subsurface water storage, modify the reach scale partitioning of water budgets, allow site specific flood attenuation, alter low flow hydrology, increase evaporation, increase water and nutrient residence times, increase geomorphic heterogeneity, delay sediment transport, increase carbon, nutrient and sediment storage, expand the extent of anaerobic conditions and interfaces, increase the downstream export of dissolved organic carbon and ammonium, decrease the downstream export of nitrate, increase lotic to lentic habitat transitions and aquatic primary production, induce 'reverse' succession in riparian vegetation assemblages, and increase habitat complexity and biodiversity on reach scales. We then examine the key feedbacks and overlaps between these changes caused by beavers, where the decrease in longitudinal hydrologic connectivity create ponds and wetlands, transitions between lentic to lotic ecosystems, increase vertical hydraulic exchange gradients, and biogeochemical cycling per unit stream length, while increased lateral connectivity will determine the extent of open water area and wetland and littoral zone habitats, and induce changes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem assemblages. However, the extent of these impacts depends firstly on the hydro-geomorphic landscape context, which determines the extent of floodplain inundation, a key driver of subsequent changes to hydrologic, geomorphic, biogeochemical, and ecosystem dynamics. Secondly, it depends on the length of time beavers can sustain disturbance at a given site, which is constrained by top down (e.g. predation) and bottom up (e.g. competition) feedbacks, and ultimately determines the pathways of river corridor landscape and ecosystem succession following beaver abandonment. This outsized influence of beavers on river corridor processes and feedbacks is also fundamentally distinct from what occurs in their absence. Current river management and restoration practices are therefore open to re-examination in order to account for the impacts of beavers, both positive and negative, such that they can potentially accommodate and enhance the ecosystem engineering services they provide. It is hoped that our synthesis and holistic framework for evaluating beaver impacts can be used in this endeavor by river scientists and managers into the future as beaver populations continue to expand in both numbers and range.","Larsen, Annegret;Larsen, Joshua R;Lane, Stuart N",2021,"ES","CP","n","river","y","several","geomorphology, presence of beavers","n","geomorph to connectivityseems interesting ","pro_13","connectivity"
"173","ecosystem metabolism and nutrient dynamics in the main channel and backwaters of the upper mississippi river","Photosynthesis and respiration are primary drivers of dissolved oxygen dynamics in rivers. We measured dissolved oxygen dynamics, aquatic ecosystem metabolism, algal abundance and nutrient concentrations at main channel and backwater sites on a reach of the Upper Mississippi River that borders the states of Wisconsin and Minnesota (U.S.A.). We asked (i) how ecosystem metabolism rates, dissolved oxygen dynamics and nutrient concentrations differed in the main channel and in backwaters, (ii) whether ecosystem metabolism relates to solar irradiance, nutrient concentration, algal abundance, temperature and river discharge and (iii) whether the relationships between ecosystem metabolism and these environmental factors differs between the main channel and backwaters. The rates of aquatic ecosystem metabolism in the main channel were among the highest reported for large rivers. Mean daily gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R) and net ecosystem production (NEP) in the main channel in the 2006 growing season were 10, 6 and 4g O(2)m(2) d(-1), respectively. Solar irradiance, discharge and temperature, rather than nutrients, accounted for most temporal variability in gross primary production (GPP). Discharge was negatively associated with GPP in the main channel and temperature positively associated with GPP in backwaters. Primary production consistently exceeded respiration in the main channel in summer, resulting in persistent oxygen supersaturation from late June to early August. Maximum chlorophyll concentrations (140g L-1) were observed in the main channel, rather than the backwaters. Nitrogen and phosphorus exhibited contrasting temporal patterns in backwaters probably reflecting differences in their sources and sinks; N declined during the growing season while P increased.","Houser, Jeffrey N.; Bartsch, Lynn A.; Richardson, William B.; Rogala, James T.; Sullivan, John F.",2015,"ES","LY","n","river","y","GPP","several environmental factors (Q, solar irradiance, nutrients, algae, DO, water temp)","y",NA,"pro_20",""
"174","flood disturbance affects macroinvertebrate food chain length in an alluvial river floodplain","Characterising food-web responses to environmental factors could greatly improve our understanding of environment-biota relationships, and especially in floodplains where trophic interactions can be particularly important during phases of hydrological disconnection. The effects of floodplain hydrology and environmental attributes on structural aspects of biotic assemblages have been extensively studied, but responses at the functional level remain largely unknown. Here, we characterised a central aspect of food-web architecture, the food chain length, as the maximum trophic position within 24 macroinvertebrate communities of parafluvial habitats in the Maggia river floodplain, in Switzerland. We investigated how the food chain length changed with different levels of habitat size, primary productivity and disturbance, the three factors potentially affecting food chain length in both theoretical and empirical studies. We found that food chain length was lower in frequently flooded habitats and immediately after a flood. We also showed that trophic omnivory, where predators fed at lower trophic levels after flooding, and in more frequently flooded habitats, may explain these changes. These findings show that trophic omnivory may explain how predators resist disturbance and are maintained in highly dynamic landscapes. More importantly, given that trophic omnivory may overall weaken trophic linkages and thus increase food-web stability, this suggests that it could be a key mechanism in sustaining biodiversity in river floodplains.","Chanut, Pierre C.

"175","hydrologic pulsing promotes spatial connectivity and food web subsidies in a subtropical coastal ecosystem","Resource pulsing is a widespread phenomenon, but its effects on ecosystem dynamics are often difficult to predict. Hydrological pulsing, in particular, is known to influence the structure and dynamics of fluvial and coastal ecosystems, but little information is available about its effects on trophic connectivity between wetlands and estuaries. We investigated the hypothesis that hydrologic pulsing drives 1-way trophic subsidies (e.g. suspended organic matter and freshwater fish) from wetland to estuary. Our study system is a coastal lagoon with an ephemeral mouth that, when closed, stores freshwater as a sustained flood pulse that is subsequently released when a connection with the sea is reestablished. We monitored isotopic composition of consumers and food sources over the course of an entire flood pulse to infer trophic linkages and spatial subsidies. Before the flood peak (April and May), freshwater and estuarine zones were largely dependent on local primary production sources (seston and C sub(3) plants vs. C sub(4) plants and microphytobenthos, respectively), essentially functioning as disconnected compartments. A sustained pulse of freshwater inflow (June to August) induced greater habitat connectivity and a net flow of biomass and energy from the freshwater zone into the estuarine zone. The opening of the lagoon outlet channel abruptly terminated the flood pulse and reduced freshwater subsidies to estuarine consumers, and both zones returned to dependence on autochthonous production. Our findings contribute to current concerns that artificial opening of sandbars in coastal lagoons alters natural ecological dynamics with significant effects on biodiversity and ecosystem processes.","Garcia, A M;Winemiller, K O;Hoeinghaus, D J;Claudino, M C;Bastos, R;Correa, F;Huckembeck, S;Vieira, J;Loebmann, D;Abreu, P;Ducatti, C",2017,"ES","RP","n","estuary","y","isotopic composition of consumers and food sources","freshwater flow pulse","y",NA,"pro_34",""
"176","intra-annual patterns in the benthic-pelagic fluxes of dissolved and particulate matter","In coastal temperate environments, many processes known to affect the exchange of particulate and dissolved matter between the seafloor and the water column follow cyclical patterns of intra-annual variation. This study assesses the extent to which these individual short term temporal variations affect specific direct drivers of seafloor-water exchanges, how they interact with one another throughout the year, and what the resulting seasonal variation in the direction and magnitude of benthic-pelagic exchange. Existing data from a multidisciplinary long-term time-series from the Western Channel Observatory, UK, were combined with new experimental and in-situ data collected throughout a full seasonal cycle. These data were used to define an average year, split into five ‘periods’ (winter, pre-bloom, bloom, post-bloom and autumn) based around the known importance of pelagic primary production and hydrodynamically active phases of the year. Multivariate analyses were used to identify specific sub-sets of parameters that described the various direct drivers of seafloor-water exchanges. Both dissolved and particulate exchange showed three distinct periods of significant flux during the year, although the specific timings of these periods and the cause-effect relationships to the direct and indirect drivers differed between the two types of flux. Dissolved matter exchange was dominated by an upward flux in the pre-bloom period driven by diffusion, then a biologically induced upward flux during the bloom and an autumn downward flux. The latter was attributable to the interactions of hydrodynamic and biological activity on the seafloor. Particulate matter exchanges exhibited a strongly hydrologically influenced upward flux during the winter, followed by a biologically induced downward flux during the bloom and a second period of downward flux throughout post-bloom and autumn periods. This was driven primarily through interactions between biological activity, and physical and meteorological drivers. The integrated, holistic and quantitative data-based analysis of intra-annual variability in benthic/pelagic fluxes presented in this study in a representative temperate coastal environment, demonstrates not only the various process’ inter-connectivity, but also their relative importance to each other. Future investigations or modelling efforts of similar systems will benefit greatly from the relationships and baseline rules established in this study.","Rühl, Saskia;Thompson, Charlie E L;Queirós, Ana M;Widdicombe, Stephen",2020,"ES","PG","y","ocean","y","organic matter ","flux direction","n","seems interesting in terms of OM fluxes but is marine","pro_41","marine"
"177","local and regional drivers of environmental changes in two subtropical montane ponds (central china) over the last two centuries","Central China, one of the Earth's distinctive ecoregions due to its endemic subtropical biota, has been subjected to enhanced nitrogen deposition and climate warming during recent decades. However, the extent and timescale of ecological changes are largely unexplored. Multiproxy analyses (diatoms, photosynthetic pigments and geochemistry) of(210)Pb-dated sediment cores from two shallow ponds within an alpine basin (central China) were used to investigate the response of primary producer communities to external stressors during the last two centuries. The study sites include one drainage pond and one seepage pond. Both ponds exhibited unambiguous changes in production and composition of photoautotrophs since the early twentieth century, which are linked to climate warming, nitrogen deposition and local factors (for example, lake morphometry, desiccation and macrophyte). Although primary producers responded to regional warming and nitrogen deposition, the ecological responses differed among ponds due to local factors. In the deeper seepage pond, light attenuation due to terrestrial organic matter input caused recent decreases in carotenoids and small fragilarioid taxa. In contrast, the co-occurrence of euterrestrial and tychoplanktonic diatoms in the shallower drainage pond was indicative of its hydrological instability. Our results indicate that subtropical montane ponds in the East Asian monsoon region appear to be strongly influenced by a combination of local (for example, catchment-lake connectivity) and regional driving forces (for example, warming and nitrogen deposition).","Chen, Xu; McGowan, Suzanne; Peng, Jia; Zheng, Ting; Bai, Xue; Zeng, Linghan",2021,"ES","CP","n","pond","y"," primary producer communities","local (light, depth) and regional factors (temp, N deposition)","y","sediment cores","pro_48",""
"178","persistence of clear-water, shallow-lake ecosystems: the role of protected areas and stable aquatic food webs","The roles of both landscape alteration and in-lake processes need to be considered in conservation strategies for shallow lakes in the prairie regions of North America. Here we focus on shallow lakes in west-central Minnesota, USA, highlighting the long-term ecological history and response to known landscape changes of a clear-water, macrophyte-dominated, shallow lake. Contemporary limnological data suggest the aquatic ecosystem has been very stable and fishless for the last ~15 years. Sediment proxies for primary production and ecological change confirm that a stable ecosystem likely prevailed for the last ~200 years. However, sedimentary indicators of catchment erosion detail a distinct response to land-use change during the conversion of native grassland to agricultural land, and following establishment of a protected waterfowl production area (WPA) around the lake. Post-WPA, the rate of sediment accrual decreased dramatically within 5-10 years and sources of organic matter were similar to those of the pre-settlement period. The aquatic ecosystem has been able to withstand nutrient enrichment and allochthonous inputs because stable trophic interactions have likely been in place for more than 200 years. We conclude that lack of hydrologic connectivity and isolated, small catchments are important factors in the promotion of clear-water shallow lake ecosystems, mainly because they prevent colonization by fish and associated ecological consequences. This study highlights the importance of managing both the landscape and in-lake processes to maintain stable, clear-water, shallow lakes.","Hobbs, William O;Theissen, Kevin M;Hagen, Sean M;Bruchu, Charles W;Czeck, Ben C;Ramstack Hobbs, Joy M;Zimmer, Kyle D",2014,"ES","CP","n","shallow lake","y","sediment (indicators of erosion) and organic matter","in lake processes?","y","ask groups' opinion","pro_55",""

To test this hypothesis, we examined the densities and species composition (structural variables), and primary productivity and respiration (functional variables) of plankton communities, and water chemistry in three spatially explicit channel, floodout and lagoon habitat types inundated by environmental water releases in the Macquarie Marshes, semi-arid Australia. Significant differences were recorded among the community-level structural and functional variables among the three habitats. Greater densities of phytoplankton, zooplankton and planktonic bacteria were observed in a hydrologically isolated floodplain lagoon. The lagoon habitat also had greater primary productivity of phytoplankton and planktonic respiration compared with the channel and floodout.

"180","the influence of fluctuating ramping rates on the food web of boreal rivers","A BAC delta (before-after-control-impact) sampling design was applied to determine the possible effects of ramping rate (RR) regulation on food webs structure and function in a regulated boreal river. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures of primary producers, macroinvertebrates and fish to determine variations in the source of carbon fuelling the food web as well as changes in the food web structure under variable RR flow regime. We hypothesized that unrestricted RR would (1) increase the connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic environments allowing for a higher contribution of terrestrial carbon to support the food web and (2) decrease food web length because of frequent disturbances. Unrestricted RR had little influence on 13C values for the overall food web with most of the differences found between impacted sites compared and control sites, indicating that the proportion of various carbon sources entering the diet of consumers remained unchanged under unrestricted RR. In contrast, significantly higher 15N values were measured in impacted sites (invertebrates and fish) and as well as under unrestricted ramping flow regime (invertebrates). Further, unrestricted RR was associated to a significant decrease in the difference between macroinvertebrates and fish 15N signatures, equivalent to a reduction of the length of the food web by at least one trophic level. Results from this study indicate that RR should be taken into consideration in the regulation of operating regimes on rivers.","Marty, Jerome;Smokorowski, Karen;Power, Michael",2009,"ES","RP","n","river","y","C and N stable isotopes of primary producers, macroinverts, and fish","ramping rate","y",NA,"pro_69",""
"181","variations in dissolved greenhouse gases (co2, ch4, n2o) in the congo river network overwhelmingly driven by fluvial-wetland connectivity","We carried out 10&#xa0;field expeditions between 2010 and 2015 in the lowland part of the Congo River network in the eastern part of the basin (Democratic Republic of the Congo), to describe the spatial variations in fluvial dissolved carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ), methane ( CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide ( N 2 O ) concentrations. We investigate the possible drivers of the spatial variations in dissolved CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O concentrations by analyzing covariations with several other biogeochemical variables, aquatic metabolic processes (primary production and respiration), catchment characteristics (land cover) and wetland spatial distributions. We test the hypothesis that spatial patterns of CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O are partly due to the connectivity with wetlands, in particular with a giant wetland of flooded forest in the core of the Congo basin, the “Cuvette Centrale Congolaise” (CCC). Two transects of 1650 km were carried out from the city of Kisangani to the city of Kinshasa, along the longest possible navigable section of the river and corresponding to 41 % of the total length of the main stem. Additionally, three time series of CH 4 and N 2 O were obtained at fixed points in the main stem of the middle Congo (2013–2018, biweekly sampling), in the main stem of the lower Kasaï (2015–2017, monthly sampling) and in the main stem of the middle Oubangui (2010–2012, biweekly sampling). The variations in dissolved N 2 O concentrations were modest, with values oscillating around the concentration corresponding to saturation with the atmosphere, with N 2 O saturation level (% N 2 O , where atmospheric equilibrium corresponds to 100 %) ranging between 0 % and 561 % (average 142 %). The relatively narrow range of % N 2 O variations was consistent with low NH 4 + ( 2.3 ± 1.3 µ mol L - 1 ) and NO 3 - ( 5.6 ± 5.1 µ mol L - 1 ) levels in these near pristine rivers and streams, with low agriculture pressure on the catchment (croplands correspond to 0.1 % of catchment land cover of sampled rivers), dominated by forests ( ∼ 70 % of land cover). The covariations in % N 2 O , NH 4 + , NO 3 - and dissolved oxygen saturation level (% O 2 ) indicate N 2 O removal by soil or sedimentary denitrification in low O 2 , high NH 4 + and low NO 3 - environments (typically small and organic matter rich streams) and N 2 O production by nitrification in high O 2 , low NH 4 + and high NO 3 - (typical of larger rivers that are poor in organic matter). Surface waters were very strongly oversaturated in CO 2 and CH 4 with respect to atmospheric equilibrium, with values of the partial pressure of CO 2 ( p CO 2 ) ranging between 1087 and 22 899 ppm (equilibrium ∼ 400 ppm) and dissolved CH 4 concentrations ranging between 22 and 71 428 nmol L - 1 (equilibrium ∼ 2 nmol L - 1 ). Spatial variations were overwhelmingly more important than seasonal variations for p CO 2 , CH 4 and % N 2 O as well as day–night variations for p CO 2 . The wide range of p CO 2 and CH 4 variations was consistent with the equally wide range of % O 2 (0.3 %–122.8 %) and of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (1.8–67.8 mg L - 1 ), indicative of generation of these two greenhouse gases from intense processing of organic matter either in “terra firme” soils, wetlands or in-stream. However, the emission rate of CO 2 to the atmosphere from riverine surface waters was on average about&#xa0;10 times higher than the flux of CO 2 produced by aquatic net heterotrophy (as evaluated from measurements of pelagic respiration and primary production). This indicates that the CO 2 emissions from the river network were sustained by lateral inputs of CO 2 (either from terra firme or from wetlands). The p CO 2 and CH 4 values decreased and % O 2 increased with increasing Strahler order, showing that stream size explains part of the spatial variability of these quantities. In addition, several lines of evidence indicate that lateral inputs of carbon from wetlands (flooded forest and aquatic macrophytes) were of paramount importance in sustaining high CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations in the Congo river network, as well as driving spatial variations: the rivers draining the CCC were characterized by significantly higher p CO 2 and CH 4 and significantly lower % O 2 and % N 2 O values than those not draining the CCC; p CO 2 and % O 2 values were correlated to the coverage of flooded forest on the catchment. The flux of greenhouse gases (GHGs) between rivers and the atmosphere averaged 2469 mmol m - 2 d - 1 for CO 2 (range 86 and 7110 mmol m - 2 d - 1 ), 12 553 µ mol m - 2 d - 1 for CH 4 (range 65 and 597 260 µ mol m - 2 d - 1 ) and 22 µ mol m - 2 d - 1 for N 2 O (range - 52 and 319 µ mol m - 2 d - 1 ). The estimate of integrated CO 2 emission from the Congo River network ( 251 ± 46 TgC (10 12 gC) yr - 1 ), corresponding to nearly half the CO 2 emissions from tropical oceans globally (565 TgC yr - 1 ) and was nearly 2&#xa0;times the CO 2 emissions from the tropical Atlantic Ocean (137 TgC yr - 1 ). Moreover, the integrated CO 2 emission from the Congo River network is more than 3&#xa0;times higher than the estimate of terrestrial net ecosystem exchange (NEE) on the whole catchment (77 TgC yr - 1 ). This shows that it is unlikely that the CO 2 emissions from the river network were sustained by the hydrological carbon export from terra firme soils (typically very small compared to terrestrial NEE) but most likely, to a large extent, they were sustained by wetlands (with a much higher hydrological connectivity with rivers and streams).","Borges, Alberto V;Darchambeau, François;Lambert, Thibault;Morana, Cédric;Allen, George H;Tambwe, Ernest;Sembaito, Alfred Toengaho;Taylor Mambo;Wabakhangazi, José Nlandu;Descy, Jean-Pierre;Teodoru, Cristian R;Bouillon, Steven",2019,"ES","MB","n","river","y","CO2, CH4, N2O","other biogeochemical variables, aquatic metabolic processes (primary production and respiration), catchment characteristics (land cover) and wetland spatial distributions","y",NA,"pro_76",""

The present study explored the spatiotemporal dynamics of wetlands, prediction of wetland risk assessment. The wetland risk assessment was predicted based on ten selected parameters, such as fragmentation probability, distance to road, and settlement. We used M5P, random forest (RF), reduced error pruning tree (REPTree), and support vector machine (SVM) machine learning techniques for wetland risk assessment. The results showed that wetland areas at present are declining less than one-third of those in 1988 due to the construction of the dam at Farakka, which is situated at the upstream of the Padma River. The distance to the river and built-up area are the two most contributing drivers influencing the wetland risk assessment based on information gain ratio (InGR). The prediction results of machine learning models showed 64.48% of area by M5P, 61.75% of area by RF, 62.18% of area by REPTree, and 55.74% of area by SVM have been predicted as the high and very high-risk zones. The results of accuracy assessment showed that the RF outperformed than other models (area under curve: 0.83), followed by the SVM, M5P, and REPTree.

It remains uncertain how the global processes of WPE and climate change may combine to impact water availability for ecosystems. Using a process-based model constrained by watershed observations, our results suggest that both xerification and climate change augment groundwater recharge by increasing channel transmission losses at the expense of plant available water. Conversion from grasslands to shrublands without creating additional bare soil, however, reduces transmission losses. Model simulations considering both WPE and climate change are used to assess their relative roles in a late 21st century condition. Results indicate that changes in focused channel recharge are determined primarily by the WPE pathway. As a result, WPE should be given consideration when assessing the vulnerability of groundwater aquifers to climate change.","Schreiner-McGraw, Adam P;Vivoni, Enrique R;Ajami, Hoori;Sala, Osvaldo E;Throop, Heather L;Peters, Debra P C",2020,"check","ES","n","n/a","y","woody plant encroachment","groundwater/water budget","n","terrestrial-based model","pro_77","connectivity"
"184","tracking the resource pulse: movement responses of fish to dynamic floodplain habitat in a tropical river","Natural river floodplains are among the Earth's most biologically diverse and productive ecosystems but face a range of critical threats due to human disturbance. Understanding the ecological processes that support biodiversity and productivity in floodplain rivers is essential for their future protection and rehabilitation. Fish assemblage structure on tropical river floodplains is widely considered to be driven by dispersal limitation during the wet season and by environmental filtering and interspecific interactions during the dry season. However, the individual-level movement behaviours (e.g. site attachment, nomadism, homing) that regulate dispersal of fish on floodplains are poorly understood. We combined radiotelemetry and remote sensing to examine the movement behaviour of two large-bodied fishes (barramundi Lates calcarifer, forktail catfish Neoarius leptaspis) over the flood cycle in a tropical river-floodplain system in northern Australia to: (a) quantify movement responses in relation to dynamic habitat resources at a landscape scale; and (b) determine the extent of spatial 'reshuffling' of individual fish following the wet season. Both species altered their behaviour rapidly in response to changes in the availability and distribution of aquatic habitat, with most individuals undertaking extensive movements (up to similar to 27 km from the tagging location) on the inundated floodplain during the wet season. Although there was considerable individual variation in movement patterns, overall barramundi distributions closely tracked the extent of floodplain primary productivity, whereas catfish distributions were most closely associated with the extent of flooded area. Most individuals of both species exhibited homing back to previously occupied dry season refugia during the wet-to-dry transition, even though other potential refugia were available in closer proximity to wet season activity areas. We postulate that homing behaviour modulates temporal variation in fish assemblage composition and abundance and limits the transfer of aquatic-derived energy and nutrients into terrestrial food webs by reducing fish mortality on drying floodplains. Our study demonstrates the importance of quantifying individual-level behaviour across the three stages of dispersal (emigration, inter-patch movement, immigration) for our understanding of how animal movement influences energetic subsidies and other large-scale ecosystem processes.","Crook, David A.; Buckle, Duncan J.; Morrongiello, John R.; Allsop, Quentin A.; Baldwin, Wayne; Saunders, Thor M.; Douglas, Michael M.",2020,"check","ES","n","river","y","fish movement/homing behavior","hydrology","y",NA,"pro_71",""
"185","biogeochemistry of carbon in the amazonian floodplains over a 2000-km reach: insights from a process-based model","The influence of Amazonian floodplains on the hydrological, sedimentary, and biogeochemical river budget was investigated over a 2000-km reach. A process-based model relying on the closure of chemical fluxes and isotopic signals was implemented. On average for the whole studied reach, the overall fluxes of carbon associated with mineralization and aquatic photosynthesis were estimated to 35.7 and 15.3 Tg C yr -1 , respectively. Almost 57% of the carbon sequestrated by photosynthesis comes from aerial sources (flooded forest); the remaining 43% resulted from aquatic sources (vrzea grasses and phytoplankton). The process rates substantially fluctuate over the annual cycle, depending particularly on the extension of flooded area and on the river-floodplain connectivity. As the river level declines, the drastic decrease of turbidity and the lower supply of carbon substrates promote autotrophy to the detriment of heterotrophy, leading to substantial changes of pH and gaseous equilibria in the river water. The main consequences are (i) the side-chain oxidation of dissolved organic matter leading to the concomitant rises of the carbon to nitrogen atomic ratio and nitrate contents and (ii) the sorption of hydrophobic humic acids, which fractionate 13 C and thus lead to 13 C-depleted particulate organic matter (fine fraction) compared to remaining dissolved organic matter. As the river flow rises, the heterotrophy prevails over autotrophy and this tends to attenuate the chemical signature imprinted by the latter. The significant contribution of aerial autochthonous sources to the budget of carbon indicates that the fluxes of mineralization are sustained by the net primary production of river corridors. The variable extension of submerged areas defines the proportions of CO 2 exported by the river and released to the atmosphere. The rate of CO 2 outgassing on the studied reach (18.8 Tg C yr -1 ) represents about 50% of the incoming dissolved inorganic carbon flux. The rate of methane emission is estimated as 2.2 Tg C yr -1 and that of denitrification is estimated as 0.87 Tg N yr -1 , representing 1.5 times the flux of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) exported by the Amazon River at the station of bidos (0.64 Tg N yr -1 ).","Jose Mauro Sousa de Moura,@ Daniel de Castro Victoria,&amp; Andre Marcondes Andrade Toledo,, Vincent;Colicchio++, Erich",2011,"MB","PG","n","floodplain/river","y","carbon flux","river level","y",NA,"pro_7",""
"186","is net ecosystem production higher in natural relative to constructed wetlands?","Ecosystem metabolism is an important measure of wetland restoration efficiency, and serves to indicate if the system is capable of processing energetic resources. Despite its value, ecosystem metabolism has rarely been included in monitoring programs. In this study, we aimed to achieve the following objectives: (i) compare net ecosystem production (NEP) rates of constructed vs. natural wetlands; (ii) identify the highest NEP rate habitats; and (iii) define the main environmental factors regulating NEP in different wetland types. Pelagic and benthic NEP rates and physicochemical features were measured in three natural and five constructed wetlands in the middle Ebro River floodplain (NE Spain). Statistical analyses showed pelagic NEP rates peaked in natural wetlands, which produced up to 187.5 mg C m(-3) h(-1) compared to lower rates in constructed wetlands (up to 46.2 mg C m(-3) h(-1)). Pelagic NEP responded positively to temperature, total dissolved solids, and nutrients. Benthic NEP rates were 3 to 30-fold greater than pelagic in natural (up to 994.9 mg C m(-3) h(-1)) and constructed (up to 1,551.5 mg C m(-3) h(-1)) wetlands, and were heavily influenced by habitat type, with NEP peaking in areas dominated by submerged vegetation and fine organic sediment. Rapid recovery in aquatic communities (i. e. macroinvertebrate diversity) has been previously reported for the studied wetlands; however, our study suggests a slower recovery of functional processes (i.e. pelagic NEP) in constructed habitats. We therefore strongly advocate the inclusion of ecosystem function in the design and evaluation of restoration projects to optimise long-term wetland ecosystem sustainability.","Espanol, Cecilia; Gallardo, Belinda; Rosa Pino, M.; Martin, Ana; Comin, Francisco A.",2013,"MB","PG","n","wetland","y","net ecosystem productivity",NA,"y","abstract does not mention connectivity","pro_42",""
"187","the influence of fluctuating ramping rates on the food web of boreal rivers","A BAC delta (before-after-control-impact) sampling design was applied to determine the possible effects of ramping rate (RR) regulation on food webs structure and function in a regulated boreal river. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures of primary producers, macroinvertebrates and fish to determine variations in the source of carbon fuelling the food web as well as changes in the food web structure under variable RR flow regime. We hypothesized that unrestricted RR would (1) increase the connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic environments allowing for a higher contribution of terrestrial carbon to support the food web and (2) decrease food web length because of frequent disturbances. Unrestricted RR had little influence on 13C values for the overall food web with most of the differences found between impacted sites compared and control sites, indicating that the proportion of various carbon sources entering the diet of consumers remained unchanged under unrestricted RR. In contrast, significantly higher 15N values were measured in impacted sites (invertebrates and fish) and as well as under unrestricted ramping flow regime (invertebrates). Further, unrestricted RR was associated to a significant decrease in the difference between macroinvertebrates and fish 15N signatures, equivalent to a reduction of the length of the food web by at least one trophic level. Results from this study indicate that RR should be taken into consideration in the regulation of operating regimes on rivers.","Marty, Jerome;Smokorowski, Karen;Power, Michael",2009,"MB","RP","n","river","y","13C and 15 N in food web","ramping rate","unsure","seems to be about connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic systems, rather than within aquatic","pro_69",""
"188","environmental factors affecting incorporation of terrestrial material into large river food webs","Three enduring conceptual models make predictions regarding the basal production sources supporting the upper food web of rivers: the River Continuum Concept, the Flood Pulse Concept, and the Riverine Productivity Model. Sources of primary production supporting metazoan biomass might best be understood by using a pluralistic approach that views basal sources as a dependent variable and key physicochemical and hydrological factors as independent variables. Here, I review studies in which chemical markers (stable-isotope and fatty-acid analyses) were used to estimate dominant primary producers contributing to consumer biomass in large rivers and evaluate associated independent variables (e.g., hydrologic regime, turbidity, concentration of dissolved organic matter, floodplain vegetation, lateral connectivity, and upstream impoundment) that have been hypothesized to contribute to variation in basal production sources. My review shows that C? grasses rarely support riverine metazoans and that algae are the predominant source of C supporting upper trophic levels of large rivers worldwide. However, I also found that many consumers assimilate material from C(3) plants in rivers with high sediment loads and low transparency during high-flow pulses. Exceptions to this pattern occur when river reaches are downstream from an impoundment, in which case, algae assume greater importance. Terrestrial C(3) plants also subsidize consumers in rivers with high dissolved organic matter concentrations via the microbial loop and, in other rivers, after periods of high discharge or leaf fall that increase the amount of terrestrial material in the particulate organic matter pool. I highlight the natural causes of differences in turbidity and dissolved organic matter among large rivers and the importance of transported materials as a source of nutrients for ecologically and economically important fish species.","Roach, Katherine A",2013,"MB","RP","n","river","n",NA,NA,"n","review paper","pro_25","type"
"189","genetic diversity and connectivity of deep-sea hydrothermal vent metapopulations","AbstractDeep-sea hydrothermal vents provide ephemeral habitats for animal communities that depend on chemosynthetic primary production. Sporadic volcanic and tectonic events destroy local vent fields and create new ones. Ongoing dispersal and cycles of extirpation and colonization affect the levels and distribution of genetic diversity in vent metapopulations. Several species exhibit evidence for stepping-stone dispersal along relatively linear, oceanic, ridge axes. Other species exhibit very high rates of gene flow, although natural barriers associated with variation in depth, deep-ocean currents, and lateral offsets of ridge axes often subdivide populations. Various degrees of impedance to dispersal across such boundaries are products of species-specific life histories and behaviours. Though unrelated to the size of a species range, levels of genetic diversity appear to correspond with the number of active vent localities that a species occupies within its range. Pioneer species that rapidly colonize nascent vents tend to be less subdivided and more diverse genetically than species that are slow to establish colonies at vents. Understanding the diversity and connectivity of vent metapopulations provides essential information for designing deep-sea preserves in regions that are under consideration for submarine mining of precious metals.","VRIJENHOEK, ROBERT C",2010,"PG","ES","y","deep-sea","y","genetic diversity","gene flow","N",NA,"pro_28","marine and type"
"190","phytoplankton dynamics in relation to connectivity, flow dynamics and resource availability the case of a large, lowland river, the hungarian tisza","Large lowland rivers with sufficient hydrological storage capacity are capable of supporting primary production, but the dynamics of the advecting phytoplankton is poorly understood. Our study aimed at exploring how longitudinal versus lateral connectivity, flow dynamics versus resource availability and continuous versus discontinuous environmental gradients shaped the species composition of phytoplankton. Samples were taken from February to October 2000 along the Hungarian Tisza River (HTR) and in its main tributaries. Longitudinal and seasonal patterns were related to resources (light and nutrients) availability and flow dynamics derived from a 1D hydrodynamic model. The HTR was autotrophic during the study period, but tributary input considerably exceeded net autochtonous production. The Szamos River was the major source of both phytoplankton and nutrients in the HTR. Chryso- and euglenophytes were flushed into the main river from floodplain oxbows during high discharge. Imported algae experienced discontinuity in environmental gradients when entering the main river. The merged impact areas of two dams (IAD) that separate the two large meandering patches of the HTR disrupted the longitudinal profiles of both physico-chemical variables and attributes of algal assemblages (biomass, species composition, richness, similarity between adjacent sampling sites). Hydraulic storage along the IAD selectively favoured the recruitment of cryptophytes that, however, could not compensate for the enhanced sedimentation of diatoms in terms of biomass. Although the meandering patches presented several small-scale differences in major environmental gradients, both patches supported the growth of planktonic diatoms. Changes in algal biomass were decoupled from nutrient availability. We conclude that various measures must be applied in various lowland rivers within the same catchment to control their trophic status as a component of the 'good ecological status' defined in the Water Framework Directive.","Istvnovics, Vera;Honti, Mrk;Vörös, Lajos;Kozma, Zsolt",2010,"PG","ES","n","river","y","phytoplankton and nutrients","longitudinal versus lateral, flow dynamics and environmental gradients ","y","very relevant ","pro_56",""
"191","woody plant encroachment has a larger impact than climate change on dryland water budgets","Woody plant encroachment (WPE) into grasslands is a global phenomenon that is associated with land degradation via xerification, which replaces grasses with shrubs and bare soil patches. It remains uncertain how the global processes of WPE and climate change may combine to impact water availability for ecosystems. Using a process-based model constrained by watershed observations, our results suggest that both xerification and climate change augment groundwater recharge by increasing channel transmission losses at the expense of plant available water. Conversion from grasslands to shrublands without creating additional bare soil, however, reduces transmission losses. Model simulations considering both WPE and climate change are used to assess their relative roles in a late 21st century condition. Results indicate that changes in focused channel recharge are determined primarily by the WPE pathway. As a result, WPE should be given consideration when assessing the vulnerability of groundwater aquifers to climate change.","Schreiner-McGraw, Adam P;Vivoni, Enrique R;Ajami, Hoori;Sala, Osvaldo E;Throop, Heather L;Peters, Debra P C",2020,"PG","ES","n","dryland","y","Woody plant encroachment","recharge","n",NA,"pro_77","not aquatic"

Vegetation dynamics within the riparian corridor are clearly influenced substantially by hydrological disturbance regimes. In turn, it is suggested that vegetation productivity and diversity may widely influence riverine biogeochemical processes, especially as related to the consequences of changing redox conditions occurring from upstream to downstream. However, surface and ground linkages are the predominant controls of landscape connectivity within riparian systems. The importance of riparian zones as sources and sinks of matter and energy was examined in context of structural and functional attributes, such as sequestering or cycling of nutrients in sediments, retention of water in vegetation, and retention, diffusion or dispersal of biota. The consequences of interactions between different communities on biogeochemical processes are notably in need of research, especially with respect to control of landscape features.","Tabacchi, E;Correll, D L;Hauer, R;Pinay, G;Planty-Tabacchi, A-M;Wissmar, R C",1998,"LY","CP","n","river","y","biogeochemical processes, retention/diffusion of biota ","connected/not connected with river?","y","focused on riparian vegetation providing the connectivity.

"193","spatial patterns of fish communities along two estuarine gradients in southern florida","Issue Title: Theme: Interaction of Hydrology and Nutrients in Controlling Ecosystem Function in Oligotrophic Coastal Environments of South Florida In tropical and subtropical estuaries, gradients of primary productivity and salinity are generally invoked to explain patterns in community structure and standing crops of fishes. We documented spatial and temporal patterns in fish community structure and standing crops along salinity and nutrient gradients in two subtropical drainages of Everglades National Park, USA. The Shark River drains into the Gulf of Mexico and experiences diurnal tides carrying relatively nutrient enriched waters, while Taylor River is more hydrologically isolated by the oligohaline Florida Bay and experiences no discernable lunar tides. We hypothesized that the more nutrient enriched system would support higher standing crops of fishes in its mangrove zone. We collected 50 species of fish from January 2000 to April 2004 at six sampling sites spanning fresh to brackish salinities in both the Shark and Taylor River drainages. Contrary to expectations, we observed lower standing crops and density of fishes in the more nutrient rich tidal mangrove forest of the Shark River than in the less nutrient rich mangrove habitats bordering the Taylor River. Tidal mangrove habitats in the Shark River were dominated by salt-tolerant fish and displayed lower species richness than mangrove communities in the Taylor River, which included more freshwater taxa and yielded relatively higher richness. These differences were maintained even after controlling for salinity at the time of sampling. Small-scale topographic relief differs between these two systems, possibly created by tidal action in the Shark River. We propose that this difference in topography limits movement of fishes from upstream marshes into the fringing mangrove forest in the Shark River system, but not the Taylor River system. Understanding the influence of habitat structure, including connectivity, on aquatic communities is important to anticipate effects of construction and operational alternatives associated with restoration of the Everglades ecosystem.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","Green, David P; J;Trexler, Joel C;Lorenz, Jerome J;Mcivor, Carole C;Philippi, Tom",2006,"LY","CP","y","estuary/coast","y","fish community diversity","connectivity with tides","n","too marine","pro_63",""
"194","hydrological connectivity drives patterns of macroinvertebrate biodiversity in floodplain rivers of the australian wet /dry tropics","1. Floodplain rivers in Australia's wet/dry tropics are regarded as being among the most ecologically intact and bio-diverse lotic ecosystems in the world, yet there have been relatively few community-based studies of their aquatic fauna. 2. To investigate relationships between hydrological connectivity and biodiversity in the region, macroinvertebrates were collected from sites within two contrasting floodplain rivers, the 'tropical' Gregory River and 'dryland' Flinders River systems, during the dry season and analysed at various spatial scales. A subset of sites was re-sampled in the following dry season to explore temporal variation. The fauna consisted of 124 morphotaxa, dominated by gatherers and the Insecta. 3. As predicted, hydrological connectivity (the lotic or lentic status of waterbodies) had a major influence on macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and diversity, both in space and time. Assemblages from waterbodies with similar connection histories were most alike, and beta-diversity between assemblages was greatest between lotic and lentic waterbodies, tending to increase with increasing spatial separation. 4. At smaller spatial scales, a number of within-waterbody, habitat and water quality characteristics were important for explaining variation (61%) in the taxonomic organization of assemblages, and characteristics associated with primary productivity and habitat diversity were important for explaining variation (45%) in the functional organization of assemblages. However, much of the small-scale environmental variation across the study region appeared to be related to broad-scale variation in hydrological connectivity, which had both direct and indirect effects on macroinvertebrate assemblages. 5. Conservation of the biodiversity in Australia's wet/dry tropics may depend on conserving the natural variation in hydrological connectivity and the unregulated flow of floodplain rivers.","Leigh, Catherine;Sheldon, Fran",2009,"LY","DC","n","floodplains/rivers","y","macroinvertebrate composition and diversity","lotic or lentic history","y","looks useful!

"195","longitudinal spatial variation in ecological conditions in an in-channel floodplain river system during flow pulses","A field survey was conducted during flow pulses to investigate the longitudinal spatial patterns in water quality, dissolved inorganic and organic matter, phytoplankton, planktonic bacteria, zooplankton, gross primary productivity (GPP) of phytoplankton and planktonic respiration (PR) in channels of the large floodplain system (124 km in length) of the Macquarie Marshes, south-eastern Australia. Four river reaches (areas) with distinct hydrogeomorphological characteristics within the distributary zone of the lower Macquarie River were chosen for analysis of abiotic and biotic variables in their in-stream environments. The results showed marked longitudinal spatial variation in the values within and among the measured environmental variables including such functional aspects as primary productivity and PR. The variables that tended to have increasing values in a downstream direction were conductivity, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), dissolved silica, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP), ratio of DOC/DON and counts of planktonic bacteria. Conversely, the values that tended to decrease downstream were the ratios of TN/TP, DIN/DRP, DOC/DOP, DON/DOP and GPP/PR. Variables that had a localized peak(s) were dissolved oxygen, turbidity, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, GPP, PR and counts of cyanobacteria, diatoms, green algae, cryptomonads, protozoans, rotifers, copepods and cladocerans. Overall, two distinct ecological zones were identified within the broader distributary functional process zone (FPZ): these being the upstream zone with relatively high levels of DO, turbidity, diatoms and GPP/PR ratio, and the downstream zone with relatively high levels of nutrients, dissolved organic matter, cyanobacteria, planktonic bacteria, protozoans and cladocerans. The results of this study describe the spatial connectivity of ecological processes related to hydrogeomorphological factors within a FPZ of a riverine ecosystem, and support the predictions of the riverine ecosystem synthesis framework that ecological patterns and processes can be discontinuous on a longitudinal spatial scale.

"196","ecosystem metabolism of benthic and pelagic zones of a shallow productive estuary: spatio-temporal variability","Long-term deterioration of water quality is known to reduce the importance of benthic ecosystem metabolism in shallow coastal ecosystems, but drivers of spatial and short-term variability in ecosystem metabolism are poorly understood. We addressed this knowledge gap through detailed seasonal measurements of ecosystem metabolism across depth gradients from shallow (2 to 3 m) eelgrass-dominated to deeper (4 to 5 m) muddy regions of a shallow, productive estuary. Combined measurements of gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R) and, by difference, net ecosystem production (NEP) by the open-water diel oxygen technique and in situ chamber incubations showed high importance of shallow eelgrass habitats for metabolism at the system scale. Seasonal variations in GPP, R and NEP increased with light availability and temperature with highest NEP in all habitats during the warm and sunny mid-summer. The shallow eelgrass-dominated and neighboring habitats were seasonally net autotrophic (NEP = 0.54 and 0.31 mg O 2 m -2 d -1 , respectively), compared to net heterotrophy (NEP = -0.26 mg O 2 m -2 d -1 ) at the deeper muddy site. Detailed studies along depth gradients further confirmed the role of eelgrass as a key driver of spatial differences in ecosystem metabolism across the estuary. Strong northerly winds (&gt;8 m s -1 ) caused short-term (&lt;24 h) periods of similar oxygen dynamics and similar apparent productivity in shallow and deeper waters, indicative of efficient lateral mixing, while calm periods (&lt;4 m s -1 ) enabled formation of pockets, i.e. water masses with limited connectivity, which exacerbated the metabolic differences between shallow and deep sites.","Staehr, Peter A;Asmala, Eero;Carstensen, Jacob;Krause-Jensen, Dorte;Reader, Heather",2018,"ES","LY","N","estuary","Y","gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R) and, by difference, net ecosystem production (NEP)","eelgrass habitat (depth)","Y",NA,"pro_21",""
"197","the role of hydrologic connections between impervious surfaces and vegetated patches in semi-arid urban environments","Urban environments are characterized by fine-scale heterogeneity, with patches of impervious surface and vegetation. In semi-arid regions where precipitation patterns are episodic, this fine scale structure may be a significant control on both storm-event runoff and seasonal water yields. From an ecological perspective, the productivity of urban vegetated patches is often limited by available water or is supported by irrigation inputs. Hydrologic connections between fine-scale impervious-surfaces and urban vegetation may influence not only runoff but also useable water for urban vegetation. Semi-arid natural ecosystems are also often characterized by fine scale vegetated - bare soil patch structures and hydrologic connections between these patches has been shown to be a significant control on shrub and forest productivity. In this paper we use an ecohydrologic model, RHESSys, to quantify the sensitivity of vegetation water use, net primary productivity and runoff to fine scale impervious surface connections in a semi arid urban settings. We use simulations on a theoretical hillslope where we can systematically vary impervious surface-vegetation fractions as well as connectivity between these patches to examine sensitivity of runoff, vegetation water use and productivity for a range of semi-arid climate forcing. We combine this analysis with watershed scale models for sites in Santa Barbara and San Diego, California to develop a first-order approximation of the potential impact of accounting for fine scale impervious connections on aggregate watershed ecohydrologic flux estimates. Results indicate that while large increases in impervious surfaces will reduce transpiration and photosynthesis, due to the sheer loss of vegetated area, the effect of decreased vegetated area can be partially or in some cases even completely offset by increased transpiration and productivity in the remaining vegetation that occurs when water is routed from impervious to vegetated areas. These results highlight the importance of accounting for fine-scale heterogeneity and hydrologic connections between patches. We conclude by presenting a modelling framework that can be used to account for these interactions.","Tague, Christina;Shields, Catherine;Anonymous",2012,"ES","MB","N",NA,"Y","photosynthesis, transpiration...","patches of impervious surface and vegetation","N","terrestrial, model-based","pro_70",""

"205","dissolved organic matter characterization in soils and streams in a small coastal low-arctic catchment","Ongoing climate warming in the western Canadian Arctic is leading to thawing of permafrost soils and subsequent mobilization of its organic matter pool. Part of this mobilized terrestrial organic matter enters the aquatic system as dissolved organic matter (DOM) and is laterally transported from land to sea. Mobilized organic matter is an important source of nutrients for ecosystems, as it is available for microbial breakdown, and thus a source of greenhouse gases. We are beginning to understand spatial controls on the release of DOM as well as the quantities and fate of this material in large Arctic rivers. Yet, these processes remain systematically understudied in small, high-Arctic watersheds, despite the fact that these watersheds experience the strongest warming rates in comparison. Here, we sampled soil (active layer and permafrost) and water (porewater and stream water) from a small ice wedge polygon (IWP) catchment along the Yukon coast, Canada, during the summer of 2018. We assessed the organic carbon (OC) quantity (using dissolved (DOC) and particulate OC (POC) concentrations and soil OC content), quality ( δ 13 C DOC, optical properties and source apportionment) and bioavailability (incubations; optical indices such as slope ratio, S r ; and humification index, HIX) along with stream water properties (temperature, T ; pH; electrical conductivity, EC; and water isotopes). We classify and compare different landscape units and their soil horizons that differ in microtopography and hydrological connectivity, giving rise to differences in drainage capacity. Our results show that porewater DOC concentrations and yield reflect drainage patterns and waterlogged conditions in the watershed. DOC yield (in mg DOC g - 1 soil OC ) generally increases with depth but shows a large variability near the transition zone (around the permafrost table). Active-layer porewater DOC generally is more labile than permafrost DOC, due to various reasons (heterogeneity, presence of a paleo-active-layer and sampling strategies). Despite these differences, the very long transport times of porewater DOC indicate that substantial processing occurs in soils prior to release into streams. Within the stream, DOC strongly dominates over POC, illustrated by DOC / POC ratios around 50, yet storm events decrease that ratio to around 5. Source apportionment of stream DOC suggests a contribution of around 50 % from permafrost/deep-active-layer OC, which contrasts with patterns observed in large Arctic rivers (12 ± 8 %; Wild et al.,&#xa0;2019). Our 10 d monitoring period demonstrated temporal DOC patterns on multiple scales (i.e.,&#xa0;diurnal patterns, storm events and longer-term trends), underlining the need for high-resolution long-term monitoring. First estimates of Black Creek annual DOC (8.2 ± 6.4 t DOC yr - 1 ) and POC (0.21 ± 0.20 t yr - 1 ) export allowed us to make a rough upscaling towards the entire Yukon Coastal Plain (34.51 ± 2.7 kt DOC yr - 1 and 8.93 ± 8.5 kt POC yr - 1 ). Rising Arctic temperatures, increases in runoff, soil organic matter (OM) leaching, permafrost thawing and primary production are likely to increase the net lateral OC flux. Consequently, altered lateral fluxes may have strong impacts on Arctic aquatic ecosystems and Arctic carbon cycling.","Speetjens, Niek Jesse;Tanski, George;Martin, Victoria;Wagner, Julia;Richter, Andreas;Hugelius, Gustaf;Boucher, Chris;Lodi, Rachele;Knoblauch, Christian;Koch, Boris P;Wünsch, Urban;Lantuit, Hugues;Vonk, Jorien E",2022,"MB","NA","n","river","y","organic carbon","unclear","include","about carbon movement and processing between terrestrial and aquatic systems in the Arctic","r3_25",NA

"207","a floodplain-scale lake classification based on characteristics of macroinvertebrate assemblages and corresponding environmental properties","Floodplain lakes have been experiencing great pressures by human activities, and ecological functionsin different types of lakes show different degrees of degradation. For facilitating conservation and management of different types of floodplain lakes, it is necessary to classify the lakes into similar groups according to certain standards. In this study, on basis of consideration of macroinvertebrate assemblages and corresponding environmental properties, the Yangtze floodplain lakes were classified into three major types grouping five groups of lakes: (1) river-disconnected lakes (algal lakes, macrophytic-algal transition lakes, and macrophytic lakes), (2) semi-connected lakes (oxbow lakes), (3) river-connected lakes. The classification of floodplain lakes mainly reflects the gradients of trophic and hydrological connectivity. The key factors structuring macroinvertebrate assemblages in the Yangtze floodplain lakes were mainly hydrological (connectivity rating, water depth), trophic (total phosphorus, macrophytes biomass) and morphometric (development of lake shoreline). Among the floodplain lakes, ecological status of river-connected lakes, where biodiversity, biomass and production of macroinvertebrates reached maxima, has been confirmed to be the best. From the view of conservation and management of the entire floodplain lakes, it is suggested that protecting the remnants of river-connected lakes, controlling eutrophication and linking disconnected lakes freely with the mainstream are crucial.","Pan, Baozhu;Wang, Hongzhu;Wang, Haijun",2014,"MB","NA","n","floodplain lakes","y","macroinvertebrate assemblages, environmental conditions","river-disconnected, semi-connected, river-connected","include","classified floodplain lakes based on macroinvertebrate assemblage; found hydrologic connectivity to be a driving factor","r3_01",NA

While such assumptions are not unreasonable, little research has been done to test this theory. Ten PAD lakes positioned along a gradient of Evaporation/Inflow ratio were examined during 2003 with the goal of studying how the hydrologic setting influences the limnology of such waterbodies. The following questions were asked in this study: 1) Does hydraulic connectivity affect the nutrient and/or light regimes of deltaic lakes? 2) Does hydraulic connectivity affect productivity of macrophyte and phytoplankton communities? 3) Does hydraulic connectivity alter the seasonality of the limno-ecology of PAD lakes? Progress towards answering these questions goals were achieved through work of the previous summer (2003). Continuation of this work in the coming summer (2004) will allow for an examination of inter-year variability. In particular the possibility of contrasting the effects of differing ice break-up conditions on the seasonal development of limnological physical, chemical and biological conditions.","Wiklund, JA;Hall, R I",1,"MB","NA",NA,NA,"n",NA,NA,"exclude","conference abstract","r3_03","type"

Lake NC-11 ( approximately 4 ha) is deep ( approximately 16 m), sheltered, dimictic, and connected to the river only during floods. Lake S-19 ( approximately 20 ha) comprises two sub-basins, a deep ( approximately 12 m) riverine forewater perennially connected to the river and a shallow ( approximately 4 m), polymictic backwater of variable connectivity. Stratification in NC-11 affected, and was affected by, river inputs - cool inflows mixed completely and sometimes destratified the lake, warmer inflows were partly or completely confined to the epilimnion. Mixing between basins at S-19 was incomplete except during floods. During floods, concentrations of seston and particulate N and P were similar in the two basins of S-19, but conditions in the two basins diverged substantially during inter-flood periods as lower water levels reduced lateral exchange. Seston concentrations in NC-11 during floods were much less ( approximately 90% less) than in S-19 or the river. In NC-11, algal blooms (chlorophyll 50-90 mu g times L super(-1)) occurred in summer post-flood periods, but larger blooms (chlorophyll 50-256 mu g times L super(-1)) occurred in the S-19 backwater during periods of low connectivity in all seasons. Nitrate-N peaked at >2 mg times L super(-1) during floods but was exhausted during algal blooms along with up to approximately 90% of dissolved phosphorus. Silica declined sharply (up to 93%) in many, but not all blooms, but remained >0.5 mg times L super(-1) in all observations. Connectivity influenced many lake features and enhanced nutrient availability, but other floodplain lakes lacking river connections have similar algal biomass.","Knowlton, M F;Jones, J R",2003,"MB","NA","n","floodplain lakes","y","nutrient dynamics, mixing, seston","perennial connection, variable connection","include","studied the impact of river inflow on mixing, seston, and nutrient dynamics in lakes with differing degrees of connectivity to the Missouri river","r3_05",NA
"210","effects of chloroplast–cytoplasm exchange and lateral mass transfer on slow induction of chlorophyll fluorescence in characeae","Rapid cytoplasmic streaming in characean algae mediates communications between remote cell regions exposed to uneven irradiance. The metabolites exported from brightly illuminated chloroplasts spread along the internode with the liquid flow and cause transient changes in chlorophyll fluorescence at cell areas that are exposed to dim light or placed shortly in darkness. The largest distance to which the photometabolites can be transported has not yet been determined. Neither is it known if lateral transport has an influence on the induction of chlorophyll fluorescence. In this study, the relations between spatial connectivity of anchored chloroplasts in characean internodes and fluorescence induction curves were examined. Connectivity between remote cell parts was pronounced upon illumination of a cell spot at a distance up to 10 mm from the area of fluorescence measurement, provided the spot was located upstream in the cytoplasmic flow. Spatial interactions between distant cell sites were also manifested in strikingly different slow stages of fluorescence induction caused by narrow‐ and wide‐field illumination. Cytochalasin D, cooling of bath solution, and inactivation of light‐dependent envelope transporters were used to disturb cyclosis‐mediated spatial interactions. Although fluorescence induction curves induced by narrow‐ and wide‐field illumination differed greatly under control conditions, they became similar after the inhibition of cyclosis with cytochalasin D. The results indicate that cytoplasmic streaming not only drives the lateral translocation of photometabolites but also promotes the export of reducing power from illuminated chloroplasts due to flushing the chloroplast surface and keeping sharp concentration gradients.","Bulychev, Alexander A;Cherkashin, Alexander A;Shapiguzov, Stepan Yu;Alova, Anna V",2021,"MB","NA","n",NA,"y",NA,NA,"exclude","about chloroplasts, not landscape/hydrologic connectivity","r3_07","connectivity"
"211","integrated fracture characterization of asmari reservoir in haftkel field","The Asmari reservoir in Haftkel field is one of the most prolific naturally fractured reservoirs in the Zagros folded zone in the southwest of Iran. The primary production was commenced in 1928 and continued until 1976 with a plateau rate of 200,000 bbl/day for several years. There was an initial gas cap on the oil column. Gas injection was commenced in June 1976 and so far, 28% of the initial oil in place have been recovered. As far as we concerned, fracture network is a key factor in sustaining oil production; therefore, it needs to be characterized and results be deployed in designing new wells to sustain future production. Multidisciplinary fracture evaluation from well to reservoir scale is a great privilege to improve model’s accuracy as well as enhancing reliability of future development plan in an efficient manner. Fracture identification and modeling usually establish at well scale and translate to reservoir using analytical or numerical algorithms with the limited tie-points between wells. Evaluating fracture network from production data can significantly improve conventional workflow where limited inter-well information is available. By incorporating those evidences, the fracture modeling workflow can be optimized further where lateral and vertical connectivity is a concern. This paper begins with the fracture characterization whereby all available data are evaluated to determine fracture patterns and extension of fracture network across the field. As results, a consistent correlation is obtained between the temperature gradient and productivity of wells, also convection phenomenon is confirmed. The findings of this section help us in better understanding fracture network, hydrodynamic communication and variation of temperature. Fracture modeling is the next step where characteristics of fractures are determined according to the structural geology and stress directions. Also, the fault’s related fractures and density of fractures are determined. Meanwhile, the results of data evaluation are deployed into the fracture model to control distribution and characteristics of fracture network, thereby a better representation is obtained that can be used for evaluating production data and optimizing development plan.","Khadivi, Kourosh;Alinaghi, Mojtaba;Dehghani, Saeed;Soltani, Mehrbod;Hassani, Hamed;Mosavi, Seyed Chaseb;Shiralipour, Mansour;Fardin, Hashem;Sanjari, Sadegh;Partovi, Mohammad",2022,"MB","NA","n",NA,"y",NA,NA,"exclude","not aquatic, about modeling fracture patterns across a oil mining field","r3_09","not aquatic"

It is necessary to understand how thermokarst lake water fluxes will react to these changes if we are to predict future greenhouse gas fluxes from lakes. Greenhouse gas fluxes from lakes are tied to the amount of lateral carbon delivery into the lake, the residence time of lake waters, and the temperature of lake waters, all of which are regulated by lake water fluxes and lake characteristics.

We measured lake water flux components at multiple spatial and temporal scales across the 5000 km (super 2) boreal-tundra transition zone between Inuvik and Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, Canada. Lake water flux components were measured at two adjacent thermokarst lakes with different ratios of lake area to catchment area (LACA), from 2017-2019. Also, stable water isotope samples were collected from March-September 2018 from approximately 100 lakes across 2000 km (super 2) . From these samples we estimated the ratio of evaporation to inflow, residence time, and the mixture of snowmelt and rainfall runoff in each lake. Catchments of all 7500 lakes in the region were delineated using a high-resolution digital elevation model in order to estimate their LACA, and evaluate connectivity between lakes. Lake temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, DOC, DON, and chlorophyll profiles were also measured from approximately 50 lakes pre-snowmelt in 2019.

Here, we monitored emissions from 20 peatland lakes across a 1,600 km permafrost transect in boreal western Canada. Contrary to expectations, we observed a shift from source to sink of CO (sub 2) for lakes warmer regions, driven by greater primary productivity associated with greater hydrological connectivity to lakes and nutrient availability in the absence of permafrost. Conversely, an 8-fold increase in CH (sub 4) emissions in warmer regions was associated with water temperature and shifts in microbial communities and dominant anaerobic processes. Our results suggest that the net radiative forcing from altered greenhouse gas emissions of northern peatland lakes this century will be dominated by increasing CH (sub 4) emissions and only partially offset by reduced CO (sub 2) emissions.

We evaluated the dynamics of Reynolds functional groups (RFGs) in response to the formation of a subtropical reservoir, in relation to the environmental changes between the pre- and post-impoundment periods. We hypothesized that the disruption of longitudinal connectivity and the changes in the light and mixing regime after the impoundment would directly influence the phytoplankton functional structure. Significant changes in the light and mixing regimes were observed after the impoundment, with the formation of a lacustrine zone, influencing the dynamics of RFGs. Fourteen RFGs were recorded. RFG C (diatoms) dominated in the pre-impoundment period. In the post-impoundment period, RFGs C, P (diatoms), and J (chlorophyceans) codominated with the highest mean values of biovolume. RFGs MP, N, H1, W2, F, E, A, W1, B, X1, and S1 contributed relatively little to the biovolume, although with higher values in the post-impoundment period. RFGs F and S1 were recorded only after the impoundment. This study revealed the important roles of physical processes and nutrients in the spatial and seasonal gradient, and in the selection of phytoplankton functional groups in a subtropical reservoir.","Souza, Dayane Garcia;Bueno, Norma Catarina;Bortolini, Jascieli Carla;Rodrigues, Luzia Cleide;Bovo-Scomparin, Vania Mara;Souza Franco, Gilza Maria",2016,"MB","NA","n","suptropical reservoir","y","Reynolds functional groups, light and mixing regimes","longitudinal, pre and post impoundment","include","studied the impact of river impoundment on phytoplankton functional structure","r3_15",NA
"215","solute transport dynamics in small, shallow groundwater-dominated agricultural catchments: insights from a high-frequency, multisolute 10 yr-long monitoring study","High-frequency, long-term and multisolute measurements are required to assess the impact of human pressures on water quality due to (i) the high temporal and spatial variability of climate and human activity and (ii) the fact that chemical solutes combine short- and long-term dynamics. Such data series are scarce. This study, based on an original and unpublished time series from the Kervidy-Naizin headwater catchment (Brittany, France), aims to determine solute transfer processes and dynamics that characterise this strongly human-impacted catchment. The Kervidy-Naizin catchment is a temperate, intensive agricultural catchment, hydrologically controlled by shallow groundwater. Over 10 yr, five solutes (nitrate, sulphate, chloride, and dissolved organic and inorganic carbon) were monitored daily at the catchment outlet and roughly every four months in the shallow groundwater. The concentrations of all five solutes showed seasonal variations but the patterns of the variations differed from one solute to another. Nitrate and chloride exhibit rather smooth variations. In contrast, sulphate as well as organic and inorganic carbon is dominated by flood flushes. The observed nitrate and chloride patterns are typical of an intensive agricultural catchment hydrologically controlled by shallow groundwater. Nitrate and chloride originating mainly from organic fertilisers accumulated over several years in the shallow groundwater. They are seasonally exported when upland groundwater connects with the stream during the wet season. Conversely, sulphate as well as organic and inorganic carbon patterns are not specific to agricultural catchments. These solutes do not come from fertilisers and do not accumulate in soil or shallow groundwater; instead, they are biogeochemically produced in the catchment. The results allowed development of a generic classification system based on the specific temporal patterns and source locations of each solute. It also considers the stocking period and the dominant process that limits transport to the stream, i.e. the connectivity of the stocking compartment. This mechanistic classification can be applied to any chemical solute to help assess its origin, storage or production location and transfer mechanism in similar catchments.","Aubert, AH;Gascuel-Odoux, C;Gruau, G;Akkal, N;Faucheux, M;Fauvel, Y;Grimaldi, C;Hamon, Y;Jaffrezic, A;Lecoz-Boutnik, M",2013,"MB","NA","n","headwater catchment, groundwater and stream","y","nitrate, sulphate, chloride, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon","unclear, related to flood pulses","include","measured solutes in stream and groundwater to study the solute transport in a human-impacted system","r3_17",NA

Six synoptic surveys, two before, two during, and two after the 2002 monsoon season, encompassed periods of both low and high stream discharge. Chloride concentrations and delta super(18)O values during low-flow periods indicated the river was divided into three hydrologically distinct reaches each roughly 30 km long. Upper and lower reaches were characterized by areas of localized groundwater input followed by downstream evapo-concentration gradients, limited downstream solute transport, and highly variable carbon and nitrogen concentrations. In contrast, the middle reach was characterized by widespread groundwater input, continuous downstream hydrologic connectivity, and less variable carbon and nitrogen concentrations. During the monsoon season, base flow discharge increased five- to ten-fold, dissolved organic matter and inorganic N increased two- to ten-fold, Fluorescence Index (FI) values indicated a large input of terrestrial solutes, and both chloride concentrations and delta super(18)O values indicated that stream water and alluvial groundwater were well mixed along the entire 95 km reach. Concurrently, the middle reach that exhibited continuous hydrologic connectivity during the nonmonsoon season was a net sink for N, while the reaches characterized by limited hydrologic connectivity during the low-flow season exhibited net N export.

"217","the production processes and characteristics of nitrogen pollution in bare sloping farmland in a karst region","Nitrogen loss in karst sloping farmland will lead to declining land productivity and environmental pollution, in which the nitrogen loss through underground pore fissures will directly lead to groundwater pollution. The characteristics of total nitrogen (TN) production were studied by simulating the ""dual structure"" microenvironment of sloping farmland in a karst region using an artificial rainfall simulation method. The results show that rainfall was the main driving factor of TN loss in karst sloping farmland. TN was mainly lost through underground pore fissures when the rainfall intensity was ≤ 30 mm · h-1. TN was lost at the surface and underground when the rainfall intensity was ≥ 50 mm · h-1, TN loss on the surface accounted for a large proportion, and the surface flow was the main carrier of TN loss. The TN loss underground is easily ignored because it is hidden underground. Therefore, TN loss belowground in karst sloping farmland should receive increased attention. It would be interesting to explore the influences of connectivity and type of underground pore fissure system on TN loss in karst sloping farmland. The prevention and control of TN loss in karst sloping farmland should be considered both at the surface and underground. Reducing the formation of slope flows and slowing rainwater filtration by increasing slope vegetation coverage can be considered to reduce TN loss. The results of this study provide a theoretical reference for agricultural non-point source pollution control in a karst region.

The lakes were located in west-central Missouri and included eight scour basins formed by levee breaks during a 1993 flood and four older oxbow lakes. The Missouri River was also sampled. Five of the scour basins (connected scours) were inundated by the Missouri River for varying periods during the study. The other lakes (protected lakes) were hydrologically isolated from the river by levees. On the basis of mean total phosphorus (TP - 61-282 mu g/L), mean total nitrogen (TN - 0.7-2.1 mg/L), mean chlorophyll (CHL - 22-67 mu g/L), and mean suspended solids (TSS - 16-93 mg/L), all 12 sites were highly eutrophic compared to other lakes in Missouri. Nutrient fractions and seston composition indicated dominance of inorganic nutrients and abiotic seston in the riverine lakes. Maximum concentrations of nutrients and TSS occurred in oxbow lakes during periods of sediment resuspension and in connected scours during floods in spring 1995 and 1996 when connected sites were inundated by the Missouri River. Algal blooms with peak CHL >200 mu g/L occurred sporadically in the oxbow lakes. Similarly large blooms (peak CHL 81-689 mu g/L) occurred in connected scours when low river levels reduced exchange with the river. Reduced connectivity was accompanied by rapid loss of dissolved N and P fractions, especially nitrate. Protected scours had lower average TP, TN, and TSS than the other sites and were less temporally variable.","Knowlton, M F;Jones, J R",1997,"MB","NA","n","floodplain lakes and river","y","total phospohorus, mean total nitrogen, mean chlorophyll, mean suspended solids","seasonally connected, isolated from river ","include","seems highly relevant; describes impact of hydrologic connectivity with the river on various nutrients and chlorophyll","r3_23",NA
"219","hydrologic influence on stream water nitrogen to phosphorus ratios","Watersheds and their complex network of flow paths regulate the movement of water and nutrients to aquatic ecosystems. Overland and subsurface (soil and ground water) flow paths transport nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) with differing levels of efficiency; P transport occurs via surface flow paths almost exclusively and N transport can utilize both overland and subsurface flow paths. Stream water N:P ratios influence ecosystem community composition, nutrient limitation of primary production, and trophic dynamics. Regional patterns of stream water N:P ratios have been identified, however, the controls driving the pattern remains poorly understood. This dissertation hypothesizes that watershed flow paths control the regional variation of stream water N:P ratios. Three independent lines of evidence were pursued to address the hypothesis: (i) a field study that quantified watershed flow paths and stream water N:P ratios in two watersheds with distinctly different hydrology; (ii) a watershed modeling exercise that simulated many different precipitation regimes and recorded the resulting flow paths and N:P ratios; (iii) a data synthesis of 58 minimally-impacted watersheds across the United States that focused on the relationship between stream water N:P ratios and stream discharge. The results from the three studies all indicate that watershed flow paths influence stream water N:P ratios. Furthermore, the results from all lines of evidence identify a possible scaling relationship between N:P ratios and stream discharge across large temporal and spatial ranges. The results suggest that watershed connectivity with the stream, defined as the sum of the active watershed flow paths, is a fundamental condition that helps explain the variability of N:P ratios, and has important implications for the watershed transport of other elements. Such information allows more informed management of aquatic ecosystems in a changing environment.","Green, Mark Benjamin",2007,"PG","NA","n ","stream","n","N, P","active watershed flow paths","n ",NA,"r3_26","dissertation"
"220","the influence of lateral hydrologic connectivity on fluvial flux and ecosystem metabolism in a river-floodplain system","Within mountainous watersheds and river networks, low-gradient valley bottoms can function as locations of high retention and biogeochemical processing. We evaluated hydrologic dynamics, nutrient flux, and aquatic ecosystem metabolism across the snowmelt hydrograph from May – October 2015 along two river segments of the North Saint Vrain Creek, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado: a valley-confined channel (confined segment) and an unconfined wet valley (unconfined segment) directly downstream. We observed significant differences in water, carbon, and nutrient flux, ecosystem metabolism, and lateral hydrologic connectivity dynamics among these contrasting segments. The confined segment was a consistent source of water, carbon, and nutrients and exported 14.4 mm of water, 26 g NO 3 -N ha -1 , 41 g dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) ha -1 , and 721 g dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ha -1 per 100 m of river length over the study period. In contrast, the unconfined segment exhibited variable source-sink dynamics and stored 1.2 g NO 3 -N ha -1 and 1.8 g DON ha -1 , and exported only 1.1 mm of water and 8 g DOC ha -1 per 100 m. The retention of water, DOC and N related to the strength of lateral connectivity between the river and the floodplain, which in turn, influenced fluvial ecosystem metabolism rates. Gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) rates were higher and more variable in the unconfined versus confined river segment; average GPP was +1.01 ± 0.76 g O 2 m -2 d -1 and ER was -1.77 ± 1.10 g O 2 m -2 d -1 in the unconfined segment, whereas average GPP was +0.09 ± 0.14 g O 2 m -2 d -1 and ER was -0.72 ± 0.50 g O 2 m -2 d -1 in the confined segment. We found that along the unconfined segment, metabolism rates generally increased from high to low flows and that the greatest increases occurred in a floodplain side-channel with intermittent surface water connections with the main channel. Combined, our data suggest a conceptual model where DOC and N are delivered to floodplain water-bodies via lateral hydrologic connections during high flows, and are subsequently utilized when velocities decline and processing rates are maximized.","Wegener, Pamela",2016,"PG","NA","n ","river-floodplain","n"," nutrient flux, and aquatic ecosystem metabolism","unconfined/confined","n",NA,"r3_28","dissertation"
"221","a tracer-based simulation approach to quantify seasonal dynamics of surface-groundwater interactions in the pantanal wetland","The Pantanal wetland is one of the least explored regions of South America. It is characterized by an outstanding flora and fauna adapted to a seasonal flood pulse controlled by a dry and a wet season within each year. The resulting inundation covers in average an area of approximately 150000km super(2) and is seen as the most important driver for ecological integrity. Evaporation from the large floodplain is supposed to influence the climate of the whole continent. The regional groundwater is connected to the surface water and plays an important role for the characteristic flooding regime by regulating the wetland's water table. The water balance assessment of the wetland and the internal water exchange between surface and groundwater is therefore of high relevance for the conservation of the Pantanal biodiversity. Despite of its importance, water balance studies including groundwater-surface water interactions based on field data are rarely undertaken. This is mainly due to the remoteness and difficulty in accessing this area, which results in lack of data. In our study, we developed a new tracer-based model to simulate the spatio-temporal surface and subsurface fluxes for a range of water bodies. The model was able to simulate these fluxes considering a dynamic simulation of inflow and outflow using a newly collected 2-year dataset of water levels, stable water isotopes and chloride collected from several water bodies in the northern Pantanal region. Quantitative differences between water bodies according to their location in the floodplain were determined by the flooding regime and connectivity as well as site-specific characteristics, such as hydraulic conductivity and water depth.

"222","changes in water chemistry associated with beaver-impounded coastal marshes of eastern georgian bay","Coastal marshes of eastern Georgian Bay contain unique water chemistry that reflects mixing between the relatively ion-rich waters of Georgian Bay and the relatively ion-poor water draining the Canadian Shield landscape. These unique chemical characteristics may be dramatically altered when wetlands become hydrologically disconnected from Georgian Bay through beaver activity. We sampled 35 coastal marshes in Georgian Bay, 17 of which had beaver impoundments built at the outlet of the coastal wetland. Impounded marshes had significantly higher total phosphorus (30.2 versus 15.3 mu g.L super(-1), p = 0.0015), soluble reactive phosphorus, (13.33 versus 3.7 mu g.L super(-1), p less than or equal to 0.0001), total suspended solids (15.5 versus 2.1 mg.L super(-1), p less than or equal to 0.0001), turbidity (5.4 versus 1.6, p = 0.0004), and chlorophyll (6.2 versus 1.9 mu g.L super(-1), p = 0.0004), but significantly lower pH (5.57 versus 6.95, p less than or equal to 0.0001), nitrates (0.03 versus 0.04 mg.L super(-1), p = 0.0416), and conductivity (47 versus 134 mu S.cm super(-1), p less than or equal to 0.0001), indicative of reduced mixing with Georgian Bay. The mosaic of chemical conditions and altered hydrological connectivity associated with beaver impoundments in coastal marshes of Georgian Bay may affect the distribution of other wetland biota, and further studies should be conducted to ascertain these impacts.","Fracz, Amanda;Chow-Fraser, Patricia",2013,"PG","NA","y","coastal marshes","y","P, suspended solids, turbidity, chl","beaver impoundments","n",NA,"r3_04","marine"
"223","development of a high-resolution land cover product of the rocky mountains with application to carbon concentrations in its streams; assessing anthropogenic, climatological, and morphological contributions","In recent decades, the Rocky Mountain (RM) region has undergone significant changes associated with anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization and forest logging for agriculture, and natural disturbances, such as wildfires and bark beetle infestations. These changes have the potential to alter primary productivity and biomass carbon storage. Specifically, changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the RM streams are relevant because dissolved organic matter affects heterotrophic processes, acts as a source for the nutrient cycle, absorbs sunlight radiation, alters the transport of metals, and can promote the appearance of carcinogenic byproducts during water treatment. Specifically, recent studies have focused on the relationship between bark beetle infestations and stream organic matter, but have reached conflicting conclusions, possibly due to the small areas analyzed or an incomplete understanding of the processes that influence organic matter concentrations. Consequently, here we compile and process multiple datasets representing changes and features of the RM region for the period 1983-2012 with the purpose of assessing their relative influence on stream DOC concentrations. Land cover (LC) is especially important for modeling DOC. LC drives many environmental processes, so its assessment, monitoring, and characterization are essential. However, existing LC products each have different temporal and spatial resolutions and different LC classes and cannot be used for our goal of studying the large scale spatial-temporal variability of DOC. Here, we review the complexities of LC identification and propose a method for fusing multiple existing LC products to produce a single LC record for a large spatial-temporal grid, referred to as spatiotemporal categorical map fusion (SCaMF). We first reconcile the LC classes of different LC products and then present a probabilistic weighted nearest neighbor estimator of LC class. This estimator depends on three unknown parameters that are estimated using numerical optimization to maximize a user-defined agreement criterion. We illustrate the method using six LC products over the Rocky Mountains and show the improvement gained by supplying the optimization with data-driven information describing the spatial-temporal behavior of each LC class. Given the massive size of the LC products, we show how the optimal parameters for a given year are often optimal for other years, leading to shorter computing times. We implement the SCaMF methodology over a large region of the RM, encompassing sections of six states, to create a new LC product, SCaMF-RM. To do this, we adapt SCaMF to address the prediction of LC in large space-time regions that present nonstationarities, and we add more flexibility in the LC classifications of the predicted product. SCaMF-RM is produced at two high spatial resolutions, 30 and 50 m, and a yearly frequency for the 30-year period 1983-2012. When multiple products are available in time, we illustrate how SCaMF-RM captures relevant information from the different LC products and improves upon flaws in other products. Future work needed includes an exhaustive validation not only of SCaMF-RM but also of all input LC products. The features of the RM region for the period 1983-2012 representing possible influences on stream DOC concentrations are grouped in four categories: anthropogenic activities, forest disturbances, climate change, and the region's morphology, including LC. We analyze the significance of each of these features when predicting base-flow DOC concentrations in the RM streams, because base-flow concentrations are more representative of the longer-term (annual to decadal) impacts. To do this, we use a statistical model to account for the possible correlation among features and for the intrinsic connectivity and hydrologic directionality of a stream network. While natural forest disturbances are positively correlated with increased DOC concentrations, the effect of urbanization is far greater. Similarly, higher maximum temperatures, which can be exacerbated by climate change, are also associated with elevated DOC concentrations. Overall, DOC concentrations present an increasing trend over time in the RM region.","Rodriguez Jeangros, Nicolas",2018,"PG","NA","n","stream","n","dissolved organic carbon"," intrinsic connectivity and hydrologic directionality of a stream network","n",NA,"r3_06","dissertation"
"224","hydrodynamic investigation of surface hydrological connectivity and its effects on the water quality of seasonal lakes: insights from a complex floodplain setting (poyang lake, china)","Small, seasonal lakes that exist in floodplains are rarely investigated, and yet they play an important role in the protection of biodiversity and are highly susceptible to modification due to human activities. This study presents a first attempt to combine hydrodynamic modeling and statistical methods to investigate hydrological connectivity and its relationship with the water quality of nine seasonal lakes within the floodplains of Poyang Lake (China). The hydrodynamic model reproduced reasonably well the hydrological regime of the lake and surrounding floodplains, based on field measurements and remote sensing data. Floodplain lakes exhibit similar water-level dynamics to the main lake during connected periods of flooding, while they decouple from the main lake during recession periods. Geostatistical results reveal that although the north-south hydrological connectivity extends over a longer pathway than the west-east connectivity, the rapid reduction in the west-east connectivity indicates a more sensitive response. The west-east connectivity tends to play a dominant role in affecting the interactions between the main lake and floodplains, as expected. Statistical methods indicate that surface hydrological connectivity across the floodplain results in an enhanced spatial similarity in the water quality of the floodplain lakes, in terms of a multitude of water quality parameters (TN, TP, NH4+-N, NO3−-N, NO2−-N, PO43−, CODMn, and Chl a), while surface hydrological isolation was observed to increase the water quality differences between the seasonal lakes. Additionally, enhanced hydrological connectivity may lead to improved water quality of the seasonal lakes from low connectivity to high connectivity condition. Hydrological connectivity may be a key factor controlling the dynamics in water quality between seasonal lakes. The findings of this study support the management of both Poyang Lake and the floodplain wetlands by providing important information on both water resource and water quality, and proposals to better manage the impacts of intensive human activities.","Li, Yunliang;Wu, Huawu;Yao, Jing;Zhang, Qi;Liu, Xinggen;Cai, Yongjiu;Tan, Zhiqiang",2019,"PG","NA","n","small, seasonal lakes that exist in floodplains","y","TN, TP, NH4+-N, NO3−-N, NO2−-N, PO43−, CODMn, and Chl a","surface hydrology","y",NA,"r3_08",NA
"225","investigation of discharge-area groundwaters for recharge source characterization on different scales: the case of jinan in northern china","Discharge-area groundwater in Jinan, a typical karst region in northern China, was investigated by studying both the hydrological and chemical processes evolving from the recharge in mountainous terrains to the karst-spring outflows in the metropolitan area. Large-scale exploitation of karst groundwater has led to a disturbing trend in the ever-decreasing spring outflow rates and groundwater level. There is insufficient information about the Jinan karst aquifers, which provide the main water sources to meet human demand and to sustain spring outflow. The coupling of hydrological and chemical processes quantifies the flow system through aqueous chemistry characterization of the water sources. This approach is used to study the groundwater flow discharges in different locations and geological settings. The potentiometric data indicated limited vertical connectivity between distinct hydrogeological units and alteration of the recharge regime by the faults and by artificial exploitation. Shallow groundwater primarily belongs to the local flow system, with high nitrate concentration and enriched stable isotopic contents. Thermal groundwater has high concentrations of chloride and total dissolved solids, derived from a regional flow system with the highest recharge altitudes and long residence time. Non-thermal karst water may be attributed to the intermediate flow system, with uniform HCO sub(3)-Ca(Mg) facies and low nitrate concentration. This work highlighted discharge as a fingerprint of groundwater flow conditions and provides a better insight into the hydrogeological system.","Wang, Jiale;Jin, Menggui;Lu, Guoping;Zhang, Dele;Kang, Fengxin;Jia, Baojie",2016,"PG","NA","n","groundwater","y","HCO sub(3)-Ca(Mg)","vertical connectivity between distinct hydrogeological units","y",NA,"r3_10",NA
"226","nutrient controls on phytoplankton composition and ecological function among hydrologically distinct habitats in the upper mississippi river ","The Upper Mississippi River (UMR) is a productive floodplain river with a complex lateral habitat array. Three habitats (main channel, flow-through backwater (moderately connected), and single-connection backwater (least connected)) in a typical UMR reach (Pool 8 near La Crosse, WI) representing a connectivity gradient (distance to main channel) were studied. Differential responses by species of phytoplankton to diverse habitat conditions promoted compositional differences among contrasting habitats. Increases in cyanobacterial blooms have raised awareness that nutrient factors may be important to UMR phytoplankton dynamics. Four main goals of my research were to identify: (1) present (1999-2004) spatiotemporal patterns in phytoplankton species composition and related nutrient regimes in UMR Pool 8, (2) which nutrients control algal production across habitat and phytoplankton assemblage type, (3) the effect of nutrient enrichment on phytoplankton composition, and (4) how nutrient enrichment affects the ecological function (N sub(2)-fixation) of bloom-forming cyanobacteria. Nutrient addition bioassays were conducted in situ to test effects of nutrient enrichment on phytoplankton. Multivariate analyses aided in the identification of multi-species differences over space and time. Results indicated that seasonal change and to a lesser extent habitat differences affected phytoplankton species composition and that phosphorus (P) was the nutrient that best explained compositional patterns. Bioassay experiments indicated that net phytoplankton production was often N-limited or co-limited by N and P but that P alone was important in the single-connection backwater. The flow-through backwater was limited most frequently and had the greatest degree of limitation overall. In general, the strongest responses to nutrient enrichment by UMR phytoplankton occurred in response to NP-enrichment and resulted in greater species diversity. Often the addition of N alone or in combination with P resulted in lower cell densities and/or relative abundance of N sub(2)-fixing cyanobacteria, while non-N sub(2)-fixing cyanobacteria and chlorophytes responded positively to N and NP enrichment. Iron was found to be a factor determining cyanobacterial species composition. N sub(2)-fixation was found to supplement cyanobacterial N-requirements in single-connection and main channel habitats and was controlled by P supply. Management programs are going to need to account for the complex spatiotemporal dynamics between phytoplankton and nutrient supply identified in this study.","Decker, Jillian Kate",2012,"PG","NA","n","river-floodplain","n","phytoplankton, N, P","habitats (main channel, flow-through backwater (moderately connected), and single-connection backwater (least connected))","n",NA,"r3_12","dissertation"
"227","phytoplankton assemblages in a reservoir cascade of a large tropical - subtropical river (se, brazil)","The phytoplankton assemblages from eight reservoirs of the Paranapanema River were studied during two consecutive years. Chlorophyceae and Bacillaryophyceae dominated in richness. The observed high number of taxa, 234, reflects the extensive sampling programme and evidences the necessity of considering the whole hydrograph basin to assess the biodiversity status of inland water ecosystems. The dams had a negative effect on phytoplankton richness, with higher number of taxa associate to riverine (non-regulated) stretches. The tributary rivers also exhibited high species richness, showing the importance of considering the lateral dimension, in addition to the longitudinal one, for aquatic biota inventories in large river basins/reservoirs. Richness and diversity were also positively influenced by the connectivity with lateral wetlands (macrophyte-dominated lakes) due to the periphyton influence. The phytoplankton abundance/biomass was not influenced by higher water retention time. Higher values occurred in the middle basin stretches (river-passage reservoirs) due to the increase in the trophic conditions. There was a positive correlation with phosphorus. Poorer light conditions in the cascade do not limit the phytoplankton biomass, with assemblages dominated by species tolerant to turbulent conditions and high mineral turbidity. Bacillariophyceae and Cryptophyceae dominated numerically. The first group (unicellular forms) was prominent in the large and oligotrophic upstream reservoirs. The second was highly abundant in the river-passage (low retention time), and more eutrophic, reservoirs. Cyanophyceae growth is probably controlled by advection processes (wash-out effect). The zooplankton does not control the phytoplankton biomass and the diversity of both groups is positively associated in the cascade. The structure of the phytoplankton assemblages showed to be a good indicator of the operationally distinct reservoirs of the Paranapanema cascade and also reflected the changes in the trophic conditions along the basin.","Nogueira, M G;Ferrareze, M;Moreira, M L;Gouvea, R M",2010,"PG","NA","n","reservoir","y","phytoplankton assemblages","dam","y",NA,"r3_14",NA
"228","phytoplankton of the middle parana river during an anomalous hydrological period: a morphological and functional approach","The Parana River mainstem was sampled monthly (November 1999-December 2000) in order to analyse phytoplankton structure and dynamics during a period of extreme low water discharge. Physiognomic groups, size fractions, taxonomic groups, species and Reynolds et al. [2002, Journal of Plankton Research, 24: 417-428] functional groups were studied in relation to environmental variables. The phytoplankton comprised an unusual development of small unicellular flagellates (1-20 mm), whereas large size algae such as the commonly recorded Aulacoseira were present with very low abundances. Groups Y (Cryptomonas spp.), X2 (Chlamydomonas spp., Rhodomonas minuta followed by a silicean chrysophyte) and D (Skeletonema cf. subsalsum and small centrics in minor proportion) dominated the phytoplankton community. Groups X2 and Y dominated at drought phase (November-December 1999). During the coupling of increasing waters and high-suspended solids (February-May 2000) minimum abundance was exhibited. The highest densities were registered during mid-waters (Y, D, X2) when a constant river-floodplain feedback occurred (September-December). The connectivity between the main channel and its alluvial valley, and their interaction resulting from the regular alternation of hydrological fluctuations, play a steering role in structuring the potamoplankton of large rivers. The multivariate RDA showed that water discharge and transparency highly explained a significant proportion of the functional groups variation. The functional classification is proposed as a useful approach in reconstructing the phytoplankton community. The differences in structure from the typically described potamoplankton for the Parana were maintained throughout the study period. The perseverance of the community changes that occurred during the drought depends, in part, on the persistence and magnitude of this anomalous phase.","Devercelli, Melina",2006,"PG","NA","n","river ","y","phytoplankton","water level","y",NA,"r3_16",NA
"229","spatial and temporal dynamics of suspended particle characteristics and composition in navigation pool 19 of the upper mississippi river","Suspended particles are an essential component of large rivers influencing channel geomorphology, biogeochemical cycling of nutrients, and food web resources. The Upper Mississippi River is a large floodplain river that exhibits pronounced spatiotemporal variation in environmental conditions and biota, providing an ideal environment for investigating dynamics of suspended particles in large river ecosystems. Here we investigated two questions: (i) How do suspended particle characteristics (e.g. size and morphology) vary temporally and spatially? and (ii) What environmental variables have the strongest association with particle characteristics? Water sampling was conducted in June, August, and September of 2013 and 2014 in Navigation Pool 19 of the Upper Mississippi River. A FlowCAM® (Flow Cytometer and Microscope) particle imaging system was used to enumerate and measure particles 53-300 µm in diameter for size and shape characteristics (e.g. volume, elongation, and symmetry). Suspended particle characteristics varied considerably over space and time and were strongly associated with discharge and concentrations of nitrate + nitrite (NO(3) ) and soluble reactive phosphorus. Particle characteristics in backwaters were distinct from those in other habitats for most of the study period, likely due to reduced hydrologic connectivity and higher biotic production in backwaters. During low discharge, phytoplankton and zooplankton made up relatively greater proportions of the observed particles. Concurrently during low discharge, concentrations of chlorophyll, volatile suspended solids, and total phosphorus were higher. Our results suggest that there are complex interactions among space, time, discharge, and other environmental variables (e.g. water nutrients), which drive suspended particle dynamics in large rivers.

"230","the main target of connection of lakes with rivers is not to dilute pollutants, but to rehabilitate natural hydrological regimes and self-purification function","Water diversion from rivers to lakes is popularly considered as a measure to control lake eutrophication, but the actual efficacy is quite limited in general. How to connect lakes with rivers in a scientific way? To answer this question, first, I analyze 5 diversion cases in China and other countries, and simulate effect of adding water using Vollen-weider's model. The results show that improving water quality by dilution depends upon whether there is large amount of input water with total phosphorus concentrations much lower than original inflow ones, but such a premise is generally difficult to meet. Second, I compare water quality of lakes disconnected and connected with the Yangtze mainstem, and find that chlorophyl a concentration of water in disconnected lakes are increased by 0.7-2.4 times when total phosphorus concentrations are in the same levels. The mechanisms of better water quality of connected lakes are fourfold, i.e., the natural water level fluctuation promotes vegetation development, seasonal trying-up and shallowing of lakeshore promotes pollutants decomposition and adsorption, turbid flowing water results in lower efficiency of nutrient utilization by phytoplankton, and the ecological complexity is higher with more heterogeneous habitats, higher biodiversity, and more complex food webs. Last, I point out that setting a scientific feasible target is the very basis to implement a river-lake connection project correctly. If the aim is to dilute pollutants, enough clean water is needed, and this can only be realized for smaller waterbodies. If the aim is to wash out phytoplankton, the flushing rate should be higher than specific growth rates of dominated algae, reaching 10%-20%/d, and this is also only feasible for smaller waterbodies. As for most lakes, in particular, shallow ones, connection of lakes with rivers should aim mainly to rehabilitate free hydrological connectivity and natural water level regimes, and then to enhance self-purification function. Such a mode costs a lesser amount of water, but reaches the best effect. This review provides important guidance for river-lake connection projects.","Wang Hong-Zhu",2021,"PG","NA","n","lake","n","chlorophyl a concentration","lake (isolated, water diversion from river)","n",NA,"r3_20","review"
"231","trophic gradients in a large-river delta: ecological structure determined by connectivity gradients in the danube delta (romania)","There are over 300 lakes interconnected by riverbranches and man-made canals in the Danube Delta (Romania). A multidisciplinary survey of these riverine lakes situated in large wetland complexes was made comprising hydrological modelling, remote sensing and monitoring of water quality, plankton, aquatic vegetation and fish communities. Between-lake differences in water quality and aquatic vegetation cover were inferred from satellite image. Based on channel and lake dimensions, hydrological characteristics of the lakes in the delta were determined: hydrological distance from a riverbranch, residence time and impact of reed water. Water-quality and biotic parameters (phyto- and zooplankton, submerged plants and fish) were sampled in a comparative survey in June 1997-1999 in subsets of the lakes. In a follow-up study in 2001-2002, seasonality of aquatic vegetation and fish were recorded. A clear distinction was found in three lake types: (1) inflow lakes at short distance to the river, with a high flushing rate, high load of suspended minerals but low chlorophyll concentrations, high cover of floating and submerged vegetation and dominance of eurytopic fish; (2) large, relatively deep lakes with moderately long residence time, high Potamogeton-cover that collapses during summer, and dominated by eurytopic fish; (3) smaller, isolated lakes at the longest distance from the river, with long residence time, of which the water quality is strongly influenced by water flows through large floating reedbeds (blackwater), with a high vegetation cover of Ceratophyllum demersum and Nitellopsis obtusa throughout the summer and a limnophilic fish community tolerant for low oxygen conditions. Aquatic vegetation showed a clear seasonality related to the interaction between plant development and light conditions. Seasonal changes in fish distribution within the system merely followed the vegetation trends in different lakes and the conditions in the river channels. Past trends in the trophic gradient are discussed in the context of hydromorphological modifications in the Delta. There is a high potential for restoring natural processes owing to the high connectivity and large scale of the system.","Coops, Hugo;Buijse, Laura L;Buijse, Anthonie D;Constantinescu, Adrian;Covaliov, Silviu;Hanganu, Jenica;Ibelings, Bas W;Menting, Geert;Navodaru, Ion;Oosterberg, Willem;Staras, Mircea;Torok, Liliana",2008,"PG","NA","n","lake","y","phyto- and zooplankton, submerged plants and fish"," three lake types","y",NA,"r3_22",NA
"232","water quality and ecology of lake kanyaboli, kenya: current status and historical changes","Small waterbodies are the most threatened freshwater habitats because of the large ratio between their size and the catchment they drain. The present study assessed the current and historical changes in the physical, chemical and biological variables of Lake Kanyaboli, a satellite lake on the northern shores of Lake Victoria in western Kenya. Primary and secondary data on pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, temperature, Secchi depth (SD), and nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations were utilized in the present study. The results indicated Secchi depth and chlorophyll-a were the most erratic of all the analyzed environmental variables studied, exhibiting a range of 0.69 +/- 0.29-0.87 +/- 0.34 m and 9.03 +/- 0.81-34.97 +/- 3.36 mu g/L respectively. Two-way ANOVA yielded no significant interactions between sampling sites and seasons for all the variables. Except chlorophyll-a, there also were no significant differences among the sampling sites for the studied variables. Seasonality yielded significant differences for Secchi depth, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a. The Carlson Trophic Index for Chl-a and SD indicated Lake Kanyaboli is currently eutrophic, while the TP concentration indicated hypereutrophic conditions. The lake, however, has fluctuated between eutrophic and hypereutrophic conditions over the past years. Although historical water quality data for the lake is scanty and infrequent, most physical and chemical variables reflected anthropogenic effects on a temporal scale. Interestingly, despite its eutrophic status, the general lake condition is still relatively good, attributable to the buffering effect from the extensive macrophytes fringing it. The present study identified nutrient loading, wetland reclamation and connectivity with the Yala River through a feeder canal as the management issues of critical concern. Accordingly continuous monitoring of the lake's water quality to detect anthropogenic effects is recommended for management intervention purposes.","Kondowe, Benjamin N.; Masese, Frank O.; Raburu, Philip O.; Singini, Wales; Walumona, Riziki Jacques",2022,"PG","NA","n","lake","y","primary and secondary data on pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, temperature, Secchi depth (SD), and nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations","unclear","y",NA,"r3_24",NA
