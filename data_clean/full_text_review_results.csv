Although A and B are situated in different sections of the DFNP, both have very similar characteristics. They have been restored by lowering the riverbank, which results in frequent changes of lentic to lotic and flowing conditions (220 (A) and 180 (B) days per year). In subsystem II two temporarily disconnected backwaters (C) and (D) were selected. Section C and D are located in a semi-separated area of the floodplain, which is protected from direct flow-through by a levee and additional weirs. Here, a surface connection of back-waters with the main channel is established only rarely (average 18 days per year), during higher water level of the Danube (>1.30m above mean water). Subsystem III informer times was an integral part of theâ€œactiveâ€ floodplain area, but due to a major regulation of the river in the nineteenth century (embankment and additional weirs), subsystem III has been permanently separated from the main channel.
