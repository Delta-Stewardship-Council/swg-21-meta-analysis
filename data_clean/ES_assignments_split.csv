an abiotic typology and reference conditions for nutrients and chlorophyll a in subtropical reservoirs são paulo state brazil ,"The establishment of reference conditions and typology are two important steps in water resources management. The reference conditions enable the determination of how impacted an ecosystem is, while the typology facilitates the implementation of management procedures. A study of subtropical reservoirs in São Paulo State (Brazil) was performed to obtain (1) an abiotic typology, using principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (Ward's method with Euclidean distances), and (2) reference conditions for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the dry and rainy seasons for one of the established typologies. Two main statistical techniques were used: the lake population distribution approach and the trisection method. PCA identified an environmental gradient in the east-west direction, with reservoirs at higher latitudes and with larger dimensions in the west, and smaller reservoirs in eastern areas with higher altitude and higher average annual rainfall. The PCA and cluster analysis indicated that there were four main types of reservoirs. The nutrient criteria techniques, obtained for 13 type I rainy-east reservoirs, were not significantly different (t test, p &lt; 0.05). Although the methods resulted in similar reference conditions, one-way ANOVA indicated significant differences between the seasons for Chl-a, which levels were slightly higher in the rainy season. As far as we know, this is the first study to simultaneously provide an abiotic typology and reference conditions for chlorophyll-a and nutrients in different seasons, considering subtropical reservoirs in South America. This investigation makes an important contribution to the monitoring and management of subtropical reservoirs, and the promotion of dialog between the scientific community and managers, aiming at ensuring the sustainability of water bodies.","Cardoso-Silva, Sheila;Frascareli, Daniele;Silva, Daniel C V R;Figueira, Rubens César Lopes;Bittencourt, Marisa Dantas;Moschini-Carlos, Viviane;Pompêo, Marcelo",Scholarly Journals,2021,28,2465440501,proquest,ES,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
patterns of fish communities and water quality in impounded lakes of china s south to north water diversion project ,"Understanding the ecological impacts of large-scale hydraulic projects is critical for maintaining ecosystem health while meeting human water needs. It is, however, currently hindered by a lack of direct evidence on ecological impacts associated with this type of project particularly on water quality and fish communities. Here, we characterized patterns and variations of fish communities and water quality in five impounded lakes of the Chinese South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), with the aim of better understanding potential ecological impacts of inter-basin water transfers. We found that 1) the impacts of water transfer on water quality in the impounded lakes was generally characterized by hydrological parameters (e.g. total suspended solids, turbidity, transparency, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and total hardness) in an upstream-downstream direction; 2) increased hydrological connectivity may have favored biological invasion (e.g. Tridentiger bifasciatus) and promoted a potential biotic homogenization among the impounded lakes; and 3) there was a pattern of decreased fish abundance and biomass from the upstream to downstream lakes with fish communities strongly driven by changing water quality patterns across the impounded lakes. These findings improve our understanding of ecological impacts of large-scale hydraulic projects and provide a significant basis for water agencies with similar water transfer systems to optimize their water transfer management in order to minimize ecological impacts.","Guo, Chuanbo;Chen, Yushun;Gozlan, Rodolphe E;Liu, Han;Lu, Ying;Qu, Xiao;Xia, Wentong;Xiong, Fangyuan;Xie, Songguang;Wang, Lizhu",Scholarly Journals,2020,713,2341614489,proquest,ES,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
phytoplankton dynamics in the congo river,"We report a dataset of phytoplankton in the Congo River, acquired along a 1700-km stretch in the mainstem during high water (HW, December 2013) and falling water (FW, June 2014). Samples for phytoplankton analysis were collected in the main river, in tributaries and one lake, and various relevant environmental variables were measured. Phytoplankton biomass and composition were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and marker pigments and by microscopy. Primary production measurements were made using the ¹³C incubation technique. In addition, data are also reported from a 19-month regular sampling (bi-monthly) at a fixed station in the mainstem of the upper Congo (at the city of Kisangani). Chl a concentrations differed between the two periods studied: in the mainstem, they varied between 0.07 and 1.77 µg L¹ in HW conditions and between 1.13 and 7.68 µg L¹ in FW conditions. The relative contribution to phytoplankton biomass from tributaries (mostly black waters) and from a few permanent lakes was low, and the main confluences resulted in phytoplankton dilution. Based on marker pigment concentration, green algae (both chlorophytes and streptophytes) dominated in the mainstem in HW, whereas diatoms dominated in FW; cryptophytes and cyanobacteria were more abundant but still relatively low in the FW period, both in the tributaries and in the main channel. Daily integrated production measured in the mainstem (n = 15) varied between 64.3 and 434.1 mg C m² day¹ in FW conditions and between 51.5 and 247.6 mg C m² day¹ in HW. Phytoplankton biomass in the Congo River mainstem was likely constrained by hydrological factors (accumulation due to increased retention time during FW, dilution by increased discharge during HW), even though increased nutrient availability in the FW period might have also stimulated phytoplankton production. In contrast to other tropical river systems where connectivity with the floodplain and the presence of natural lakes and man-made reservoirs play a prominent role in the recruitment of phytoplankton to the main river, our results show that phytoplankton growth in the Congo River can take place in the main channel, with hydrological processes allowing maintenance of phytoplankton biomass even during HW.","Descy, Jean-Pierre;Darchambeau, François;Lambert, Thibault;Stoyneva-Gaertner, Maya P;Bouillon, Steven;Borges, Alberto V",Scholarly Journals,2017,62,2000461867,proquest,ES,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
effects of lake basin morphological and hydrological characteristics on the eutrophication of shallow lakes in eastern china,"The Yangtze River floodplain contains numerous oxbow or riverine lakes, all of which were openly connected with the Yangtze River or its major tributaries prior to 1950s. However, stresses resulting from human settlement and utilization of catchment resources have exerted great pressures on these lake ecosystems changing their morphology, connectivity and trophic state lakes. This study examined the interaction of these changes and their impact on eutrophication for 90 shallow lakes in eastern China in 2008 to 2011. TN and TP in the study lakes had negative relationships with mean water depth (Zmean), but no single lake-basin characteristic was found to dominate chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) growth. Instead, water depth and surface area were found to interactively affect Chl-a concentrations in smaller lakes. That is, Chl-a concentration in the lakes with Zmean&gt;2m and surface area (SA)¤25km2 was significantly higher than that in relatively larger lakes with Zmean&gt;2m and SA&gt;25km2 (p-value¤0.038). Chl-a concentration was higher in the lakes located within the lower Yangtze River basin which had longer retention times, than in the lakes located within the middle Yangtze River basin, where flow velocity is relatively larger. As expected, the water quality was found to be better in the lakes hydraulically connected with rivers than in those isolated from the river. This study revealed that lake-basin morphology and hydrology dominated algal blooms in the highly eutrophic shallow lakes in eastern China.","Huang, Jian;Xu, Qiujin;Beidou Xi;Wang, Xixi;Jia, Keli;Huo, Shouliang;Su, Jing;Zhang, Ting;Li, Caole",Scholarly Journals,2014,40,2000316314,proquest,ES,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
spatial connectivity in a large river system resolving the sources and fate of dissolved organic matter ,"Large rivers are generally heterogeneous and productive systems that receive important inputs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial and in situ sources. Thus, they are likely to play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of the DOM flowing to the oceans. The asymmetric spatial gradient driven by directional flow and environmental heterogeneity contributes to the fate of DOM flowing downstream. Yet, the relative effects of spatial connectivity and environmental heterogeneity on DOM dynamics are poorly understood. For example, since environmental variables show spatial heterogeneity, the variation explained by environmental and spatial variables may be redundant. We used the St. Lawrence River (SLR) as a representative large river to resolve the unique influences of environmental heterogeneity and spatial connectivity on DOM dynamics. We used three-dimensional fluorescence matrices combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to characterize the DOM pool in the SLR. Seven fluorophores were modeled, of which two were identified to be of terrestrial origin and three from algal exudates. We measured a set of environmental variables that are known to drive the fate of DOM in aquatic systems. Additionally, we used asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM) modeling to take spatial connectivity into account. The combination of spatial and environmental models explained 85% of the DOM variation. We show that spatial connectivity is an important driver of DOM dynamics, as a large fraction of environmental heterogeneity was attributable to the asymmetric spatial gradient. Along the longitudinal axis, we noted a rapid increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), mostly controlled by terrestrial input of DOM originating from the tributaries. Variance partitioning demonstrated that freshly produced protein-like DOM was found to be the preferential substrate for heterotrophic bacteria undergoing rapid proliferation, while humic-like DOM was more correlated to the diffuse attenuation coefficient of UVA radiation.","Massicotte, Philippe;Frenette, Jean-Jacques",Scholarly Journals,2011,21,903662303,proquest,ES,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
the significance of side arm connectivity for carbon dynamics of the river danube austria,"1. Side-arms connected to the main stem of the river are key areas for biogeochemical cycling in fluvial landscapes, exhibiting high rates of carbon processing. 2. This work focused on quantifying autochthonous and allochthonous carbon pools and, thereby, on comparing transport and transformation processes in a restored side-arm system of the River Danube (Regelsbrunn). We established a carbon budget and quantified carbon processing from March to September 2003. In addition, data from previous studies during 1997 to 1999 were assessed. 3. Gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration were estimated by diel oxygen time curves and an oxygen mass balance. Plankton primary production was determined to estimate its contribution to GPP under different hydrological conditions. 4. Based on the degree of connectivity, three hydrological phases were differentiated. Most of the organic matter, dominated by allochthonous carbon, was transported in the main channel and through the side-arm during floods, while at intermediate and low flows (and thus connectivity), transformation processes became more important and autochthonous carbon dominated the carbon pool. The side-arm system functioned as a sink for particulate matter [total suspended solids and particulate organic carbon (POC)] and a source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chlorophyll-a. 5. Autochthonous primary production of 4.2 t C day¹ in the side-arm was equivalent to about 20% of the allochthonous inputs of 20 t C day¹ (POC and DOC) entering the area at mean flow (1% of the discharge of the main channel). Pelagic photosynthesis was generally high at mean flow (1.3-3.8 g C m² day¹), and contributed up to 90% of system productivity. During long stagnant periods at low discharge, the side-arm was controlled by biological processes and a shift from planktonic to benthic activity occurred (benthic primary production of 0.4-14 g C m² day¹). 6. The transformation of the organic matter that passes through the side-arm under different hydrological conditions, points to the importance of these subsystems in contributing autochthonous carbon to the food web of the main channel.","Preiner, S;Drozdowski, I;Schagerl, M;Schiemer, F;Hein, T",Scholarly Journals,2008,53,47516161,proquest,ES,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
hydrological connectivity and flood pulses as the central aspects for the integrity of a river floodplain system,"Interactions between the Danube river and its backwaters were analysed by determining the correspondence between river fluctuation and ground- and back-water levels and the extent of surface connectivity within the river floodplain at different water levels. Samples from a longitudinal and a lateral transect taken during low water mean water, high water and flood were analysed for inorganic nutrients, suspended solids and chlorophyll-a. In longitudinal, connectivity decreased with distance from the Danube. At low water sample there was no surface connection between the river and its backwaters. Conditions in backwaters were determined by internal processes, characterized by low concentrations of nutrients and suspended solids. As water levels increased, local surface inflow and seepage caused nutrient pulses and eutrophication. The significance of flood pulses for dynamics of biological processes was emphasized by short-term changes. The response of different water bodies depended on connectivity to the river. Floods reset the ecosystem at an earlier successional stage. In the pelagic zone, floods removed biota and established initial set points.","Heiler, G;Hein, T;Schiemer, F;Bornette, G",Scholarly Journals,1995,11,13645558,proquest,ES,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
changing characteristics and driving factors of trophic state of lakes in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river in the past 30 years,"To understand the current eutrophication status, main drivers of eutrophication and restoration strategy of Yangtze-connected or Yangtze-isolated lakes (historically connected to the Yangtze River but isolated by artificial dikes currently), the trophic parameters and main water quality variables were surveyed seasonally in 27 large lakes and reservoirs of this region during 2017 to 2018. In addition, the temporal eutrophication dynamics and associated driving mechanisms of these lakes over the past 30 years were analyzed based on the historical data of these lakes (investigated during 1988 to 1992 and 2008). Our results showed that most of the lakes in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River were eutrophic now, and significantly worse than the status of 1988 to 1992, mainly contributed by chlorophyll-a of phytoplankton and total phosphorus. Human activities, including changes of water retention time (primarily depend on the lake-Yangtze connection condition), fishery activities, catchment pollution condition, and lake restoration are decisive factors in shaping the eutrophication status of these lakes. Comparing with the historical records, phytoplankton chlorophyll-a and associated organic matter concentrations are increased drastically, while nutrients (e.g., total phosphorus and nitrogen) experienced relatively small increase, yet. Therefore, it is suggested that the non-nutrients factors were the major causes which strengthen the eutrophication risk. From the perspective of restoration strategies of lakes in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River, it is crucial that rebuild the hydrological connectivity, restore natural water level fluctuation, optimize the fishery management and enhance the catchment nutrient abatement ability and applying the in-lake restoration engineering.",Zhu Guangwei; Xu Hai; Zhu Mengyuan; Zou Wei; Guo Chaoxuan; Ji Pengfei; Da Wenye; Zhou Yongqiang; Zhang Yunlin; Qin Boqiang,Scholarly Journals,2019,31,BIOSIS:PREV202000014603,wos,ES,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
freshwater inflow and responses from estuaries across a climatic gradient an assessment of northwestern gulf of mexico estuaries based on stable isotopes,"Estuaries exist across a large climatic gradient in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, capturing a range of hydrologic conditions and estuarine functioning. We examined freshwater inflow, salinity, and stable isotope compositions (delta C-13, delta N-15) of oysters, suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM), and surface sediment organic matter (SSOM) from five estuaries across the hydrologic gradient. All five estuaries experienced large decreases in freshwater inflow over the last 40 yr, with three estuaries being subject to freshwater inflow reductions of more than 85%. Generally, these freshwater inflow decreases were associated with estuarine salinity increases. Across the spatial gradient, average salinity generally increased from northeast to southwest estuaries. SPOM in the northeastern, lower salinity estuaries generally contained more continental organic matter and was of higher quality (i.e., lower C/chlorophyll a ratio), as compared to southwestern, higher salinity estuaries. Similarly, both SSOM and oyster delta C-13 values were positively correlated with salinity, further highlighting that food webs in lower salinity estuaries are more greatly influenced by continental organic matter than those in higher salinity estuaries. A decrease in the connectivity between continental and coastal habitats may have broad consequences for flows of organic matter, and estuarine function and health. Conducting studies across large-scale hydrologic gradients can provide a useful approach to informing and predicting shifts in estuarine functioning.","Marshall, Danielle A.; La Peyre, Megan K.; Palmer, Terence A.; Guillou, Gael; Sterba-Boatwright, Blair D.; Pollack, Jennifer Beseres; Lebreton, Benoit",Scholarly Journals,2021,66,BIOSIS:PREV202100871021,wos,ES,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
metal pollution in the pearl river estuary and implications for estuary management the influence of hydrological connectivity associated with estuarine mixing,"Understanding the metal pollution can help governments and estuary management groups manage metal inputs. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the behaviors of seven metals Cd, Zn, Cu, As, Pb, Cr, and Hg in water and the responses of these metals to hydrological connectivity in the Pearl River Estuary. The analyses were based on the field measurements of August-2016 in the estuary and January-2016 in the upper river mouth. We also assessed the ecosystem health of these metals. Overall, this estuary had an overall moderate pollution level, with occasional severe perturbations. The mean concentration of individual metal was in the order of Zn > As > Cu > Cr > Pb > Cd > Hg. The eastern estuary was more heavily polluted by metals (notably, Zn, Cd, and Cu) than the western estuary; this condition was attributable to sewage and industrial effluent discharges from the eastern urban cities of Dongguan and Shenzhen. Longitudinally, high levels of Cd and Zn appeared in the upper estuary, while elevated levels of Cu, As, Pb, Cr, and Hg were found in the middle and lower estuaries. The riverine inputs and estuarine mixing significantly influenced the distribution and movement of trace metals in the estuary, and have contributed to phytoplankton productivity (chlorophyll-a > 10 mu g/L). River inflow inhibited the vertical diffusion of metals, and tidal currents facilitated surface-to-bottom mixing. Cu and Cd posed ecological risks. We determined the source contributions and transport routes of the metals using principal component analysis combining with multiple linear regression. The results of this study suggest that the source apportionment of metals can help to manage the source input entering into the estuary. Further, identified hydrological connectivity of metals can inform water quality managers in the highly anthropogenically influenced estuary.","Niu, Lixia; Cai, Huayang; Jia, Liangwen; Luo, Xiangxin; Tao, Wei; Dong, Yanhong; Yang, Qingshu",Scholarly Journals,2021,225,BIOSIS:PREV202100881636,wos,ES,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
correlates of zooplankton beta diversity in tropical lake systems,"The changes in species composition between habitat patches (beta diversity) are likely related to a number of factors, including environmental heterogeneity, connectivity, disturbance and productivity. Here, we used data from aquatic environments in five Brazilian regions over two years and two seasons (rainy and dry seasons or high and low water level periods in floodplain lakes) in each year to test hypotheses underlying zooplankton beta diversity variation. The regions present different levels of hydrological connectivity, where three regions present lakes that are permanent and connected with the main river, while the water bodies of the other two regions consist of permanent lakes and temporary ponds, with no hydrological connections between them. We tested for relationships between zooplankton beta diversity and environmental heterogeneity, spatial extent, hydrological connectivity, seasonality, disturbance and productivity. Negative relationships were detected between zooplankton beta diversity and both hydrological connectivity and disturbance (periodic dry-outs). Hydrological connectivity is likely to affect beta diversity by facilitating dispersal between habitats. In addition, the harsh environmental filter imposed by disturbance selected for only a small portion of the species from the regional pool that were able to cope with periodic dry-outs (e.g., those with a high production of resting eggs). In summary, this study suggests that faunal exchange and disturbance play important roles in structuring local zooplankton communities.","Lopes, Paloma M.; Bini, Luis M.; Declerck, Steven A.

granal stacking of thylakoid membranes in higher plant chloroplasts the physicochemical forces at work and the functional consequences that ensue,"The formation of grana in chloroplasts of higher plants is examined in terms of the subtle interplay of physicochemical forces of attraction and repulsion. The attractive forces between two adjacent membranes comprise (1) van der Waals attraction that depends on the abundance and type of atoms in each membrane, on the distance between the membranes and on the dielectric constant, (2) depletion attraction that generates local order by granal stacking at the expense of greater disorder (i.e. entropy) in the stroma, and (3) an electrostatic attraction of opposite charges located on adjacent membranes. The repulsive forces comprise (1) electrostatic repulsion due to the net negative charge on the outer surface of thylakoid membranes, (2) hydration repulsion that operates at small separations between thylakoid membranes due to layers of bound water molecules, and (3) steric hindrance due to bulky protrusions of Photosystem I (PSI) and ATP synthase into the stroma. In addition, specific interactions may occur, but they await experimental demonstration. Although grana are not essential for photosynthesis, they are ubiquitous in higher plants. Grana may have been selected during evolution for the functional advantages that they confer on higher plants. The functional consequences of grana stacking include (1) enhancement of light capture through a vastly increased area-to-volume ratio and connectivity of several PSIIs with large functional antenna size, (2) the ability to control the lateral separation of PSI from PSII and, therefore, the balanced distribution of excitation energy between two photosystems working in series, (3) the reversible fine-tuning of energy distribution between the photosystems by State 1-State 2 transitions, (4) the ability to regulate light-harvesting via controlled thermal dissipation of excess excitation energy, detected as non-photochemical quenching, (5) dynamic flexibility in the light reactions mediated by a granal structure in response to regulation by a trans-thylakoid pH gradient, (6) delaying the premature degradation of D1 and D2 reaction-centre protein(s) in PSII by harbouring photoinactived PSIIs in appressed granal domains, (7) enhancement of the rate of non-cyclic synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as well as the regulation of non-cyclic vs. cyclic ATP synthesis, and (8) the potential increase of photosynthetic capacity for a given composition of chloroplast constituents in full sunlight, concomitantly with enhancement of photochemical efficiency in canopy shade. Hence chloroplast ultrastructure and function are intimately intertwined.","Chow, Wah Soon; Kim, Eun-Ha; Horton, Peter; Anderson, Jan M.",Scholarly Journals,2005,4,BIOSIS:PREV200600205047,wos,ES,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
