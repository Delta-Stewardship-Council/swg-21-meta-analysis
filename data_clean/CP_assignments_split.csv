"water level as the key controlling regulator associated with nutrient and gross primary productivity changes in a large floodplain-lake system (lake poyang), china","A floodplain lake system can be described as a water conveyance-type lake system that is subject to high water-level fluctuations (WLFs). This study investigated the effects of WLF on the nutrient status and the gross primary productivity (GPP) of phytoplankton in Lake Poyang, a large floodplain-lake system in China. This study hypothesized that WLF is the key controlling regulator of the lake’s nutrient status, phytoplankton growth and GPP, driven by its influence on the lake’s hydrological connectivity in combination with water-flow velocity as well as other environmental parameters. The results showed that the intra-annual water levels in this lake varied from 7.61 m to 20.82 m while inter-annual water levels significantly decreased throughout 1989–2018 (P &lt; 0.05). Except for pH, most environmental variables and nutrients differed significantly each season. Mean GPP and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration during the water rising period was clearly higher compared to the dry season, wet season and falling period. Moreover, nutrient concentration was the main determining factor of phytoplankton growth and GPP during different periods, while water temperature (WT) also played a key role in influencing phytoplankton biomass and GPP during the water rising period. There was also a direct correlation between WLF and GPP during the water rising period, and WLF significantly affected nutrient concentration, subsequently impacting GPP. This study can benefit our overall knowledge of hydrological and ecological dynamics in floodplain-lake systems, while providing an important reference for policymakers in the management of dams and water quality in floodplain-lake systems globally.","Wang, Shuoyue;Gao, Yang;Jia, Junjie;Kun, Sun;Lyu, Sidan;Li, Zhaoxi;Lu, Yao;Wen, Xuefa",Scholarly Journals,2021,599,2574374455,proquest,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
circulation patterns of biogenic ions in young glacial areas,"The paper focuses on the effect of ponds (geographically isolated wetlands) on water quality within internally drained areas in a river catchment. The important part of the study was the point of formation of a periodic hydrographic network of internally drained areas linked with a main river as well as the identification of the circulation pattern of ions in such a system. The aim of the study was to examine the extent to which ponds pollute the main river upon physical connection with it. Research has shown that ponds participate actively in material circulation-including that of water and biogenic ions. The hydrographic network in Young Glacial areas is subject to very large seasonal changes. In the study area, the total length of the stream network in the dry season equaled 12 km, while in the wet season almost 75 km. At the same time, almost 50% of the internally drained areas in the catchment became connected with the surface runoff network. Such large seasonal changes in the hydrographic network yield large changes in stream water chemistry. In the study area, only 6 ponds were linked to the stream network during the dry season, while in the wet season, this number increased to 125. The parts of catchments featuring the largest changes in the hydrographic network as well as the largest number of ponds temporarily linked with surface runoff networks were characterized by a high content of total nitrogen and phosphorus-up to 244.2 kg N km2 per month and 26.2 kg P km2 per month.","Pietruszyński, Łukasz;Cieśliński, Roman",Scholarly Journals,2021,193,2475093102,proquest,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"biological responses to recent eutrophication and hydrologic changes in xingyun lake, southwest china","The synergistic influence of multiple environmental stressors on lake ecosystems has typically been evaluated paleolimnologically, through examination of a single biological indicator. Aquatic organisms, however, may display heterogeneous responses because of differences in their ecological sensitivity, and/or because of ecological consequences caused by strong interactions among multiple stressors. We applied paleolimnological methods to compare patterns of algal and invertebrate response to multiple stressors in a large, shallow lake in southwest China over the last two centuries. Our multi-proxy records show a clear trajectory of lake eutrophication (greater total nitrogen) and increasing lake productivity (greater sediment Chlorophyll-a concentration) during the last century. Nutrient enrichment and lake productivity played significant, but different roles, in structuring diatom and cladoceran assemblages, accounting for 31.4 and 77.3% of the total variance in the communities, respectively. Furthermore, there was a pronounced influx of the endemic diatom species Cyclotella rhomboideo-elliptica Skuja, which was strongly associated with the second axis of a diatom PCA (Principal Component Analysis). This occurred synchronously with a documented reversal of hydrological connectivity with a downstream, nutrient-poor lake during the early twentieth century, suggesting a role for species dispersal in modulating community reorganization. There are also strong differences between the two organism groups in their sensitivity to hydrological fluctuations, as hydrodynamics, indicated by sand content, was a significant driver for cladocerans (>25%), but showed only minor influence on diatom assemblages in our selection of minimum adequate models. The proportion of the total variance explained by our measured variables (<30%) was much lower for diatom assemblages than for both cladoceran assemblage and accumulation data ( approximately 77%), reflecting differences in community reorganization between the two biological indicators. The sediment-based evaluation of community responses revealed the differential impact of eutrophication and hydrological fluctuations on the biota of this large, shallow lake. Therefore, multiple biological indicators should be evaluated in limnological surveys to assess the full scope of ecological changes in highly stressed lake systems targeted for conservation or restoration.

"using stressor-response models to derive numeric nutrient criteria for lakes in the eastern plain ecoregion, china","Lakes in the Eastern Plain ecoregion of China are typically shallow, experience large disturbances, and are hydrologically connected to rivers. In recent years, lake eutrophication in this ecoregion has intensified due to human activities. To determine important regional nutrient criteria, the effects of hydrologic features and disturbances should be taken into account. In this paper, annual average data were used to construct stressor-response models for each hydrological lake type identified for lakes in the Eastern Plain ecoregion. In these models, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) criteria were obtained from a chlorophyll a (Chl-a, response variable) threshold value. A Chl-a concentration of 4.73 mu gL super(-1) was identified as this threshold value, which was based on the cyanotoxin limits associated with drinking water supply. The three lake types, which differed in hydrological structure, had significantly different TN and TP criteria. For example, lakes connected to the Yangtze River (T sub(1)) had a TN criterion ranging from 0.594 to 0.838mgL super(-1), which was substantially higher than those for lakes that were never connected to the river (T sub(3), 0.234-0.422mgL super(-1)). The exception to this trend occurred for lakes that were historically but not currently connected to the river (T sub(2)) due to P-limitation in this lake type. However, there was little variability in the TP criterion among T sub(1), T sub(2), and T sub(3) lakes, the values of which ranged from 0.021 to 0.037, 0.023 to 0.042, and 0.028 to 0.041mgL super(-1), respectively. This study hypothesized that the hydrological connectivity between lakes and rivers could regulate the relationships between stressors and their biological responses in lakes in the Eastern Plain ecoregion, leading to variability in appropriate nutrient criteria for different lake types. Setting nutrient criteria for the entire ecoregion and for different lake types by using stressor-response models will make the criteria values more credible and defensible.","Zhang, Yali;Huo, Shouliang;Ma, Chunzi;Xi, Beidou;Li, Xiang;Liu, Hongliang",Scholarly Journals,2014,42,1627975893,proquest,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"a limnological examination of the southwestern amazon, madre de dios, peru","This dissertation investigates the limnology of the southwestern Peruvian Amazon centered on the Madre de Dios department by examining first the geomorphology and then the ecology and biogeochemistry of the region's fluvial systems. Madre de Dios, Peru is world renowned for its prolific biodiversity and its location within the Andes biodiversity hotspot. It is also a site of study regarding the development of the Fitzcarrald Arch and that feature's geomorphological importance as the drainage center for the headwaters of the Madeira River--the Amazon's largest tributary and as well as its role as a physical divider of genetic evolution in the Amazon. Though each of these has been studied by a variety of prominent researchers, the ability to investigate all the aspects of this unique region is hampered by the lack of a regional geomorphological map. This study aims to fill that gap by using remote sensing techniques on digital elevation models, satellite imagery and soil, geology and geoecological maps already in publication to create a geomorphological map. The resulting map contains ten distinct landform types that exemplify the dominance of fluvial processes in shaping this landscape. The river terraces of the Madre de Dios River are delineated in their entirety as well as the various dissected relief units and previously undefined units. The demarcation of the boundaries of these geomorphic units will provide invaluable assistance to the selection of field sites by future researchers as well as insights into the origin of the high biodiversity indices of this region and aid in planning for biodiversity conservation. Secondly this study examines 25 tropical floodplain lakes along 300 km of the Manu River within the Manu National Park in the Madre de Dios department. Alternative stable state and regime shifts in shallow lakes typically have been examined in lakes in temperate and boreal regions and within anthropogenically disturbed basins but have rarely been studied in tropical or in undisturbed regions. In contrast this study focuses on a tropical region of virtually no human disturbance and evaluates the effects of hydrological variability on ecosystem structure and dynamics. Using satellite imagery a 23 yr timeline of ecological regime shifts in Amazon oxbow lakes or ""cochas"" is reconstructed. The study shows that almost 25% of the river's floodplain lakes experience periodic abrupt vegetative changes with an average 3.4% existing in an alternative stable state in any given year. State changes typically occur from a stable phytoplankton-dominated state to a short lived, <3 yr, floating macrophytic state and often occur independent of regional flooding. We theorize that multiple dynamics, both internal and external, drive vegetative regime shifts in the Manu but insufficient data yet exists in this remote region to identify the key processes. To complete the investigation of tropical limnology the third study compares and contrasts the nutrient-productivity ration of floodplain and non-floodplain lakes globally and regionally. For over 70 years a strong positive relationship between sestonic chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total phosphorus (TP) has been established with phosphorus generally viewed as the most limiting factor to productivity. Most of these studies, however, have focused on northern, temperate regions where the lakes are typically postglacial, isolated and fed by small streams. Relatively little work has been done on floodplain lakes which are semi or permanently connected to the river. This study examines the relationship between nutrients and productivity in floodplain lakes globally through an extensive literature synthesis. Values for total phosphorus, total nitrogen and chlorophyll-a were collected for 523 floodplain lakes, represented by 288 data points while 551 data points were collected for 5444 non-floodplain lakes. Analysis revealed that globally, floodplain lakes do not show any significant difference in the total phosphorus/chlorophyll-a relationship from that found in non-floodplain lakes but significant differences are seen between tropical and temperate lakes. We propose that the term 'floodplain' lake should serve as purely a geographical descriptor and that it is lacking as an ecological indicator. Instead factors such as precipitation seasonality, hydrological connectivity and regional flooding regimes are better indicators of high or low productivity in floodplain lakes.","Belcon, Alana Urnesha",Books,2012,73,1439231762,proquest,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
spatial heterogeneity in trophic status of shallow lakes on the boreal plain: influence of hydrologic setting,"We used metrics of surface water and groundwater connectivity as explanatory variables in nonparametric regression models to explain the spatial heterogeneity in trophic status of shallow lakes. The concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a) was used as an indicator of trophic status and was estimated from 17 Landsat images acquired during the end of summer (August) over a 20-year period from 1984 to 2003. A long-term median of Chl a was computed for each of 40 lakes on the basis of the 17-year data set. Hydrologic metrics explained 72% of the spatial variation in Chl a. The regression tree showed that lakes with a higher concentration of calcium plus magnesium (Ca + Mg) exhibited higher Chl a than lakes with a lower Ca + Mg. We hypothesized that this trend was a result of either higher internal nutrient loading in high Ca + Mg lakes due to groundwater discharge or differences in surficial geology. Among high Ca + Mg lakes, lakes with no inflowing streams had lower Chl a, while connected lakes had higher Chl a, possibly reflecting enhanced nutrient delivery to lakes connected to the stream network. Among low Ca + Mg lakes, lakes with larger wetland cover in their drainage basins had lower Chl a, while lakes with smaller wetland cover in their drainage basins had higher Chl a, possibly reflecting differential water loading rates between small and large wetlands that lead to either Chl a concentration or dilution. These results suggest that relatively simple hydrologic metrics can be used to predict the trophic status of lakes in this area of the boreal forest.","Sass, G Z;Creed, I F;Devito, K J",Scholarly Journals,2008,44,48182161,proquest,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"role of lhcii-containing macrodomains in the structure, function and dynamics of grana","In higher plants and green algae two types of thylakoids are distinguished, granum (stacked) and stroma (unstacked) thylakoids. They form a three-dimensional (3D) network with large lateral heterogeneity: photosystem II (PSII) and the associated main chlorophyll a/b light-harvesting complex (LHCII) are found predominantly in the stacked region, while PSI and LHCI are located mainly in the unstacked region of the membrane. This picture emerged from the discovery of the physical separation of the two photosystems (Boardman and Anderson 1964). Granal chloroplasts possess significant flexibility, which is essential for optimizing the photosynthetic machinery under various environmental conditions. However, our understanding concerning the assembly, structural dynamics and regulatory functions of grana is far from being complete. In this paper we overview the significance of the three-dimensional structure of grana in the absorption properties, ionic equilibrations, and in the diffusion of membrane components between the stacked and unstacked regions. Further, we discuss the role of chiral macrodomains in the grana. Lateral heterogeneity of thylakoid membranes is proposed to be a consequence of the formation of macrodomains constituted of LHCII and PSII; their long range order permits long distance migration of excitation energy, which explains the energetic connectivity of PSII particles. The ability of macrodomains to undergo light-induced reversible structural changes lends structural flexibility to the granum. In purified LHCII, which has also been shown to form stacked lamellar aggregates with long range chiral order, excitation energy migrates for large distances; these macroaggregates are also capable of undergoing light-induced reversible structural changes and fluorescence quenching. Hence, some basic properties of grana appear to originate from its main constituent, the LHCII.","Garab, G;Mustardy, L",Scholarly Journals,1999,NA,925182554,proquest,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
lake age and water level affect the turbidity of floodplain lakes along the lower rhine,"1. We sampled a set of 93 lakes situated in the floodplains of the lower River Rhine in search for morphometric and other factors that explain their variation in clarity. 2. Lakes with a drop in summer water level were less turbid at the time of sampling, mainly because of a lower concentration of inorganic suspended solids (ISS). 3. We also found that older lakes were more turbid than younger lakes and that this was largely because of an increase in phytoplankton. 4. Water clarity was positively related to lake depth and the presence of vegetation. 5. Model calculations indicated that the underwater light climate was strongly affected by chlorophyll and ISS, the latter being the dominant factor affecting Secchi depth. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was less important. 6. The high concentration of ISS suggests that intensive resuspension occurs in most of the lakes. Using a simple wave model, and assuming that vegetation protects sediments against resuspension, we could eliminate wind resuspension as an important process in 90% of the lakes, leaving resuspension by benthivorous fish as probably the most important factor determining transparency. 7. Chlorophyll a concentration showed a strong positive correlation to ISS concentration, suggesting that resuspension may also have a positive effect on phytoplankton biomass in these lakes. 8. In conclusion, in-lake processes, rather than river dynamics, seem to be driving the turbidity of floodplain lakes along the lower River Rhine.","Roozen, F. C. J. M.; Van Geest, G. J.; Ibelings, B.

"seasonal fluctuation of some limnological variables on a floodplain lake (patos lagoon) of the upper parana river, mato grosso do sul state, brazil","Temporal variations of some limnological variables in limnetic and littoral regions of Patos lagoon, a varzea lake on the floodplain of the Upper Parana River (22degree 43'12S e 53degree 17'37W), were studied in relation to hydrological and climatological factors. Measurements of water temperature, euphotic zone, suspended material, electrical conductivity, total alkalinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, total nitrogen, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, dissolved phosphorus, reactive soluble phosphorus and chlorophyll a were taken monthly between March 1993 and February 1994. Results lend evidence to the importance of the hydrological regime on the dynamic of limnological variables in floodplain lakes. A dilution of nutrients in the lagoon, especially phosphates, occurred during floods. This was followed by fertilization of the environment by nutrients from the inundated marginal regions. During low connectivity periods, autochthonous, events such as ressuspension of sediment, brought on by wind and rain, governed limnological events in the lagoon.","Rodrigues, Luzia Cleide; Train, Sueli; Roberto, Maria do Carmo; Pagioro, Thomaz Aurelio",Scholarly Journals,2002,45,BIOSIS:PREV200300162521,wos,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"effects of flow variation on channel and floodplain biota and habitats of the sacramento river, california, usa","1. Despite progress in the development of conceptual models of river processes, the validation and application of these models to conservation may be limited by a deficit of tools for intermediate-scale (1-100km) reaches. A model was developed to examine the effect of variation in flow on the responses of two trophic levels in a large temperate river (Sacramento River) and its seasonal floodplain (Yolo Bypass). Field data and hydrologic simulations were evaluated for three hydrologically diverse years. 2. The simulations showed much more hydrologic variability in the floodplain than the river, with greater total surface and shallow area, longer hydraulic residence times, and lower water velocities for the floodplain. 3. Chlorophyll a levels were significantly higher in the floodplain than in the river, and were negatively associated with flow. These results were consistent with longer hydraulic residence times, increased surface area of shallow water, and warmer water temperatures. 4. Copepods and cladoceran densities were similar in the river and its floodplain, and were mostly negatively associated with flow. 5. There were significantly higher densities of Diptera and terrestrial invertebrates in the floodplain than the river. Diptera densities in the floodplain were positively associated with flow. 6. These results provide evidence of the incremental value of floodplain habitat to the conservation of large rivers. In particular, it appears that providing river floodplain connectivity can enhance production of lower trophic levels at relatively rapid time scales, probably benefitting secondary consumers, including Chinook salmon (Onchyrhynchus tshawytscha).

correlates of zooplankton beta diversity in tropical lake systems,"The changes in species composition between habitat patches (beta diversity) are likely related to a number of factors, including environmental heterogeneity, connectivity, disturbance and productivity. Here, we used data from aquatic environments in five Brazilian regions over two years and two seasons (rainy and dry seasons or high and low water level periods in floodplain lakes) in each year to test hypotheses underlying zooplankton beta diversity variation. The regions present different levels of hydrological connectivity, where three regions present lakes that are permanent and connected with the main river, while the water bodies of the other two regions consist of permanent lakes and temporary ponds, with no hydrological connections between them. We tested for relationships between zooplankton beta diversity and environmental heterogeneity, spatial extent, hydrological connectivity, seasonality, disturbance and productivity. Negative relationships were detected between zooplankton beta diversity and both hydrological connectivity and disturbance (periodic dry-outs). Hydrological connectivity is likely to affect beta diversity by facilitating dispersal between habitats. In addition, the harsh environmental filter imposed by disturbance selected for only a small portion of the species from the regional pool that were able to cope with periodic dry-outs (e.g., those with a high production of resting eggs). In summary, this study suggests that faunal exchange and disturbance play important roles in structuring local zooplankton communities.","Lopes, Paloma M.; Bini, Luis M.; Declerck, Steven A.

"influence of hydrological connectivity on winter limnology in floodplain lakes of the saskatchewan river delta, saskatchewan","Globally, hydrological connectivity between rivers and their floodplains has been reduced by river flow management and land transformation. The Saskatchewan River Delta is North America's largest inland delta and a hub for fish and fur production. To determine the influence of connectivity on limnology within this northern floodplain, water chemistry and stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) were analyzed during the winter of 2014 in 26 shallow lakes along a hydrological gradient. A total of five lake connectivity categories were determined by optical remote sensing imagary of surface water coverage area from years of varying flood intensities. Accuracy of categories was verified by degree of O-18 and H-2 enrichment within lakes. Both isotopes showed marked successional enrichment between connectivity categories, with more isolated lakes exhibiting greater enrichment. Water chemistry in lakes with greater connectivity to the main channel were characterized by higher pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and sulfates and lower total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and ammonium compared with more isolated lakes. These findings illustrate how connectivity influences water chemistry in northern floodplain lakes and how it might determine the suitability of these lakes as winter refuge for fishes. Additionally, our study provides supporting evidence for the effective use of optical remote sensing imagery, an inexpensive and accessible source of data for researchers, when determining connectivity characteristics of large northern floodplain systems. Additionally, this study provides further evidence that the inundation of floodplain lakes by river water during peak discharge has an impact on the conditions within the lakes long into the winter ice-cover season. Understanding the year-round influence of river-floodplain connection is imperative for assessing potential impacts of climate change and future water regulation on such ecosystems.","MacKinnon, Brett D.; Sagin, Jay; Baulch, Helen M.; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich; Jardine, Timothy D.",Scholarly Journals,2016,73,BIOSIS:PREV201600234351,wos,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
