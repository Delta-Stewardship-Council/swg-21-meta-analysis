water level as the key controlling regulator associated with nutrient and gross primary productivity changes in a large floodplain lake system lake poyang china,"A floodplain lake system can be described as a water conveyance-type lake system that is subject to high water-level fluctuations (WLFs). This study investigated the effects of WLF on the nutrient status and the gross primary productivity (GPP) of phytoplankton in Lake Poyang, a large floodplain-lake system in China. This study hypothesized that WLF is the key controlling regulator of the lake’s nutrient status, phytoplankton growth and GPP, driven by its influence on the lake’s hydrological connectivity in combination with water-flow velocity as well as other environmental parameters. The results showed that the intra-annual water levels in this lake varied from 7.61 m to 20.82 m while inter-annual water levels significantly decreased throughout 1989–2018 (P &lt; 0.05). Except for pH, most environmental variables and nutrients differed significantly each season. Mean GPP and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration during the water rising period was clearly higher compared to the dry season, wet season and falling period. Moreover, nutrient concentration was the main determining factor of phytoplankton growth and GPP during different periods, while water temperature (WT) also played a key role in influencing phytoplankton biomass and GPP during the water rising period. There was also a direct correlation between WLF and GPP during the water rising period, and WLF significantly affected nutrient concentration, subsequently impacting GPP. This study can benefit our overall knowledge of hydrological and ecological dynamics in floodplain-lake systems, while providing an important reference for policymakers in the management of dams and water quality in floodplain-lake systems globally.","Wang, Shuoyue;Gao, Yang;Jia, Junjie;Kun, Sun;Lyu, Sidan;Li, Zhaoxi;Lu, Yao;Wen, Xuefa",Scholarly Journals,2021,599,2574374455,proquest,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
circulation patterns of biogenic ions in young glacial areas ,"The paper focuses on the effect of ponds (geographically isolated wetlands) on water quality within internally drained areas in a river catchment. The important part of the study was the point of formation of a periodic hydrographic network of internally drained areas linked with a main river as well as the identification of the circulation pattern of ions in such a system. The aim of the study was to examine the extent to which ponds pollute the main river upon physical connection with it. Research has shown that ponds participate actively in material circulation-including that of water and biogenic ions. The hydrographic network in Young Glacial areas is subject to very large seasonal changes. In the study area, the total length of the stream network in the dry season equaled 12 km, while in the wet season almost 75 km. At the same time, almost 50% of the internally drained areas in the catchment became connected with the surface runoff network. Such large seasonal changes in the hydrographic network yield large changes in stream water chemistry. In the study area, only 6 ponds were linked to the stream network during the dry season, while in the wet season, this number increased to 125. The parts of catchments featuring the largest changes in the hydrographic network as well as the largest number of ponds temporarily linked with surface runoff networks were characterized by a high content of total nitrogen and phosphorus-up to 244.2 kg N km2 per month and 26.2 kg P km2 per month.","Pietruszyński, Łukasz;Cieśliński, Roman",Scholarly Journals,2021,193,2475093102,proquest,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
shifts of environmental and phytoplankton variables in a regulated river a spatial driven analysis ,"The longitudinal structure of the environmental and phytoplankton variables was investigated in the Ebro River (NE Spain), which is heavily affected by water abstraction and regulation. A first exploration indicated that the phytoplankton community did not resist the impact of reservoirs and barely recovered downstream of them. The spatial analysis showed that the responses of the phytoplankton and environmental variables were not uniform. The two set of variables revealed spatial variability discontinuities and river fragmentation upstream and downstream from the reservoirs. Reservoirs caused the replacement of spatially heterogeneous habitats by homogeneous spatially distributed water bodies, these new environmental conditions downstream benefiting the opportunist and cosmopolitan algal taxa. The application of a spatial auto-regression model to algal biomass (chlorophyll-a) permitted to capture the relevance and contribution of extra-local influences in the river ecosystem.","Sabater-Liesa, Laia;Ginebreda, Antoni;Barceló, Damià",Scholarly Journals,2018,642,2058504095,proquest,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
abiotic variability among different aquatic systems of the central amazon floodplain during drought and flood events ,"This paper examines water properties from lakes, (depression lakes, sensu Junk et al., 2012), channels (scroll lakes with high connectivity, sensu Junk et al., 2012) and paleo-channels (scroll lakes with low connectivity-sensu Junk et al., 2012, locally called ressacas) located in Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve, in Central Amazon floodplain, Amazonas, Brazil. We analysed surface temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, transparency, suspended inorganic and organic matter, chlorophyll-a, pheophytin, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, organic and inorganic carbon in 2009 high water phase, 2009 and 2010 low water phases. Multivariate statistical analyses of 24 aquatic systems (6 ressacas, 12 lakes and 6 channels, 142 samples) were applied to the variables in order to: 1) quantify differences among aquatic system types; 2) assess how those differences are affected in the different phases of the hydrological year. First, we analysed the entire set of variables to test for differences among phases of the hydrological year and types of aquatic systems using a PERMANOVA two-way crossed design. The results showed that the all measured limnological variables are distinct regarding both factors: types of aquatic systems and hydrological phases. In general, the magnitude and amplitude of all variables were higher in the low water phase than in the high water phase, except for water transparency in all aquatic system's types. PERMANOVA showed that the differences between aquatic system's types and hydrological phases of all variables were highly significant for both main factors (type and phase) and for the type x phase interaction. Limnological patterns of Amazon floodplain aquatic systems are highly dynamic, dependent on the surrounding environment, flood pulse, main river input and system type. These patterns show how undisturbed systems respond to natural variability in such a diverse environment, and how distinct are those aquatic systems, especially during the low water phase. Aquatic systems in Mamirauá floodplain represent limnological patterns of almost undisturbed areas and can be used as future reference for comparison with disturbed areas, such as those of the Lower Amazon, and as a baseline for studies on the effects of anthropogenic influences and climate change and on Amazon aquatic ecosystem.","Affonso, A G;Queiroz, H L;Novo, E M L M",Scholarly Journals,2015,75,1750431438,proquest,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
floodplain lake assessment and fish assemblage dynamics in the mississippi alluvial valley mississippi alluvial valley ,"Floodplain lakes in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (MAV) provide valuable freshwater resources for states in which they occur. Thirty lakes in portions of Mississippi and Arkansas were surveyed for chlorophyll-a fluorescence and turbidity using handheld meters to determine relationships between chlorophyll-a concentrations and suspended solids. High applicability of handheld meters in the MAV presents economic benefits for monitoring the numerous lakes in the region. Additionally, twelve lakes within Bear Creek watershed, Mississippi were studied to determine how hydrologic connectivity shapes fish communities. Isolated and permanently connected floodplain lakes exhibited characteristically lacustrine and rheophilic fish communities, respectively, diversifying fishery management opportunities. Lastly, spring diel temperature and oxygen dynamics, as well as juvenile fish communities, were assessed within three habitats in a floodplain lake - pelagic environment, margin and contiguous wetlands. Variability in temperature and oxygen across the three habitats promotes spring habitat heterogeneity while supporting distinct but overlapping juvenile fish assemblages.","Steiner Andrews, Caroline Noelle",Books,2013,52,1520375284,proquest,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
rotifer abundance biomass and secondary production after the recovery of hydrologic connectivity between a river and two marginal lakes sao paulo brazil ,"Rotifera density, biomass, and secondary production on two marginal lakes of Paranapanema River were compared after the recovery of hydrologic connectivity with the river (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Daily samplings were performed in limnetic zone of both lakes during the rainy season immediately after lateral inflow of water and, in the dry period, six months after hydrologic connectivity recovery. In order to identify the factors that affect rotifer population dynamics, lake water level, volume, depth, temperature, transparency, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, conductivity, suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a were determined. Variations of water physical and chemical factors that affect rotifer population were related to the lake-river degree of connection and to water level rising after drought. The water lateral inflow from the river resulted in an increase in lake water volume, depth, and transparency and a decrease in water pH, alkalinity, and suspended solids. The lake with the wider river connection, more frequent biota exchange, and larger amount of particulate and dissolved materials was richer and more diverse, while rotifer density, biomass, and productivity were lower in both periods studied. Density, biomass, and secondary production were higher in the lake with the smaller river connection and the higher physical and chemical stability. Our results show that the connectivity affects the limnological stability, associated to seasonality. Stable conditions, caused by low connectivity in dry periods, were related with high density, biomass and secondary production. Conversely, instability conditions in rainy periods were associated to elevated richness and diversity values, caused by exchange biota due to higher connectivity.","Casanova, Silvia Maria Caglierani;Panarelli, Eliana Aparecida;Henry, Raoul",Scholarly Journals,2009,39,883018575,proquest,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
hydrologic controls on the trophic status of shallow lakes on the boreal plain ,"The trophic status of shallow lakes on the Boreal Plain of Alberta exhibits high natural variation in space and time. It is not currently known what the dominant controls on this variation are at regional scales and over longer time periods. The aim of this thesis is to characterize the natural variation in trophic status, as measured by the concentration of chlorophyll a (CHLa), and assess the importance of hydrology, captured by climatic and landscape metrics, in explaining the spatial and temporal variation in trophic status. Indicators of trophic status were derived from Landsat images acquired during late summer (August) over a 20 year period from 1984 to 2003. A two-way analysis of variance revealed that of the total variation in CHLa, approximately 50 percent was in the spatial component, 10 percent was in the temporal component and 40 percent was in the spatio-temporal component, which also included the error term. Variation in the temporal component was related non-linearly to climate, as measured by effective precipitation (precipitation minus evapotranspiration). The relation between CHLa and climate indicated that under wet conditions CHLa decreased possibly due to phosphorus dilution and that under dry conditions CHLa increased possibly due to phosphorus concentration. Variation in the spatial component was related to indicators of groundwater and surface water connectivity. Lakes, situated in regional groundwater flow systems, exhibited higher CHLa than lakes situated in local groundwater flow systems. For the majority of lakes, situated in local groundwater flow systems, high wetland cover in their catchments corresponded to low CHLa whereas low wetland cover corresponded to high CHLa. For the minority of lakes, located in regional groundwater flow systems, higher stream connectivity was associated with higher CHLa. Overall, groundwater and surface water variables explained 74 percent of the spatial variation and climatic variables explained 78 percent of the temporal variation. These results underscore the importance of considering hydrology when understanding the sources of variation in trophic status measured at regional scales over long time periods. Incorporating hydrologic knowledge in resource management may help in mitigating impacts of resource activities.","Sass, Gabor Z",Books,2006,68,20435600,proquest,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
the hydrochemical response of small and shallow floodplain water bodies to temporary surface water connections with the main river,"We investigated the effects of temporary surface water connections with the main river on the water chemistry of large and small waterbodies in a Danube floodplain by comparing hydrochemical data before, during and after water exchange with the Danube during two large floods in 2009 and 2013. In addition, we studied the effects of an increased frequency of flood pulses on the water chemistry of the floodplain via long-term monitoring data. We used conservative (i.e. biologically non-reactive) parameters (alkalinity, Ca, Cl, K, Mg, Na, SO4, conductivity) to identify hydrochemical changes due to the mixing with river water. Changes in non-conservative parameters (PO4-P, NO3-N, NO2-N, NH4-N, total phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a), which deviated from pure mixing effects, were ascribed to alterations of biogeochemical processes induced by the imported river water. In large floodplain waterbodies, both conservative and non-conservative parameters changed towards Danube water concentrations during the connection with the main river and returned to pre-connection levels after the water exchange ended. Only chlorophyll-a concentrations were almost twice as high in the post-connection phase than before the connection. In small floodplain waterbodies, conservative and non-conservative parameters showed similar changes during the connection with the main river. However, the concentrations of PO4-P, total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a did not return to pre-connection levels, but increased further in the post-connection phase, exceeding even Danube water concentrations. We attribute these changes to phosphorus releases from the sediments and enhanced primary and bacterial production induced by the river water. In years with an increased flooding frequency, both conservative and non-conservative parameters approached Danube water concentrations in large floodplain waterbodies due to the increased surface water exchange. In small floodplain waterbodies, conservative parameters remained unaffected by the increased connection with the river, while nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations were considerably higher in wet years than in dry years. We conclude that the temporary input of oxygen- and nutrient-rich river water to small, mainly isolated backwaters can induce changes in benthic biogeochemical processes, which may provoke an internal eutrophication of these waterbodies.","Weigelhofer, Gabriele; Preiner, Stefan; Funk, Andrea; Bondar-Kunze, Elisabeth; Hein, Thomas",Scholarly Journals,2015,60,BIOSIS:PREV201500321559,wos,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
influence of a drought event on hydrological characteristics of a small estuary on the amazon mangrove coast,"The effects of atypical climatic conditions, such as those of a drought event, are remarkably accentuated in minor estuaries filled with sediments and with reduced or sporadic freshwater input, where the salinity intrusion is pronounced. To understand these effects, hydrological and hydrodynamic parameters were evaluated during a drought period in a small estuary located on the eastern Amazon coast in northern Brazil. Five campaigns were conducted between June 2012 and June 2013. Samples were collected from the surface and bottom layer every 3 h over a 25-h period at three stations of the Tapera double dagger u Estuary. To compare drought and post-drought periods, in terms of salinity and chlorophyll-a, data was recorded until June 2015. Tapera double dagger u is a relatively shallow estuary of the Amazon coastal zone, which is characterized by the absence of any direct fluvial discharge, although it does receive freshwater input from adjacent wetlands, as well as less saline waters from the Caet, Estuary through the Taici Creek. Hydrological variables were controlled by rainfall levels and the tidal range, and the water became more saline and more oxygenated, with reduced dissolved nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations when precipitation decreased. A significant variation was found between the months of June 2012 (most intense drought) and 2013 (less intense drought). The connection to the neighboring Caet, Estuary and adjacent mangroves and wetlands contributed to the influx of nutrient-enriched waters. Overall, then, it is hoped that the results of this study can contribute to the understanding of the effects of drought events in other minor estuaries on the highly indented Amazon coast, as well as in other areas of the equatorial zone with similar environmental characteristics.","Carneiro Pereira, Luci Cajueiro; Rodrigues da Costa, Adila Kelly; da Costa, Rauquirio Marinho; Magalhaes, Andre; Flores-Montes, Manuel de Jesus; Jimenez, Jose A.",Scholarly Journals,2018,41,BIOSIS:PREV201800387074,wos,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
the impact of inundation isolation cycles on the culturable bacterioplankton in the danube river floodplain,"The investigation was conducted in the Kopacki Rit Nature Park (eastern Croatia) which is established to protect the floodplain area of the Danube River. The samples were collected monthly in four sites (channels and lakes) with increasing distance from the river. The aim of investigation was to examine trophic structure of culturable bacterioplankton in relation to inundation-isolation cycles on sampling sites with unequal degree of connection with the Danube river. A change in the ratio of copiotrophs (r- strategists) to oligotrophs (K-strategists) was expected as the different organic carbon sources emerged. The composition of variables was revealed by Principal Component Analysis of abiotic water properties (temperature, water depth, transparency, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nutrient concentrations) and the chlorophyll-a concentration. Scores of significant components were used in a Multiple Regression as independent variables and the relationship between the scores and abundance of colony forming units (CFUs) was examined. Regression model was significant only for copiotrophs, and their relative dominance was noticed in couple of samples on more isolated sampling sites. In all other samples oligotrophs were a dominant group, especially during the flood pulses or drainage after it. Their elevated abundance was equally distributed in all groups revealed by Principal Component Analysis, and corresponds to the fluvial action. Also concerning the two-way ANOVA (sites/samplings) oligotrophs are highly influenced by the sampling period i.e. inundation-isolation cycles. They are probably driven by the allochthonous organic matter provided by floods or have allochthonous origin itself. At the same time, copiotrophs are to some extent coupled with the established water properties, i.e. bottom-up controlled and their abundance is influenced by the localisation of sampling sites in the floodplain. These results describe the development of the conditions that promote habitat specific succession of the culturable bacterioplankton. Established differences had disappeared after additional inundation-isolation cycles.","Palijan, Goran; Bogut, Irella; Vidakovic, Jasna",Scholarly Journals,2008,56,BIOSIS:PREV200800604505,wos,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
bacterioplankton from two hungarian danube river wetlands beda karapancsa danube drava national park and its relations to environmental variables,"Seasonal and spatial distribution of bacterioplankton from two Hungarian oxbow lake type wetlands, Mocskos-Danube and Riha, was studied. They were both covered by macrophytes and they had different hydrological connectivity to the Danube. The six sampling campaigns from April to October 2014 included parallel samples from the Danube River at Mohacs, Hungary. Bacterial abundance was the highest in spring and in Mocskos-Danube, followed by Mohacs and Riha. Positive relationships existed between bacterioplankton and temperature on one hand and suspended solids, pH, PO4-P and chl-a on the other. Negative correlations were with DOC, dissolved oxygen and NH4-N.","Kalcheva, Hristina; Dinka, Maria; Agoston-Szabo, Edit; Berczik, Arpad; Kalchev, Roumen; Tarjanyi, Nikolett; Kiss, Anita",Scholarly Journals,2016,18,BIOSIS:PREV201800624763,wos,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
connectivity and habitat typology drive co2 and ch4 fluxes across land water interfaces in lowland rivers,"Lowland rivers are assumed to be a net source of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). However, little is known about the contribution of marginal permanent and temporary riverine aquatic systems to river carbon metabolism. Elevation, in relation to flooding, hydro-morphological, and ecological features of such habitats, can affect the gas fluxes across the water-atmosphere interfaces and the periodically air-exposed riverbeds. This hypothesis was investigated in the lowland sector of the Po River (Northern Italy) from May to September 2008. Five different aquatic habitats were considered: the main river course; a backwater habitat; and three lateral lentic waterbodies-an oxbow and two quarry lakes of different age. The water mass was always CO2 and CH4 supersaturated, and gas fluxes were from the water to the atmosphere. In the highly dynamic river course and backwaters, CO2 emission rates were nearly one order of magnitude greater than in the lentic and hypoxic oxbow and quarry lakes. By contrast, CH4 fluxes peaked in the lentic, deeper, and permanent water bodies. At sediment-atmosphere interfaces, the CO2 emissions increased along an organic matter, a water saturation, and a chlorophyll a gradient, attaining the maximum rates in the periodically air-exposed riverbed and marginal sandy sediments. These differences in gas fluxes resulted from either the submersion persistence or the alternation of submersion and emersion phases, which were ultimately due to the gap between elevation and river water variations. All this stresses the critical role of marginal aquatic habitats for river C budget.","Bolpagni, Rossano; Laini, Alex; Mutti, Tiziana; Viaroli, Pierluigi; Bartoli, Marco",Scholarly Journals,2019,12,BIOSIS:PREV201900212838,wos,CP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
