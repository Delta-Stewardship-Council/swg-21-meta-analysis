"1","analysis of anthropogenic, climatological, and morphological influences on dissolved organic matter in rocky mountain streams","In recent decades, the Rocky Mountains (RM) have undergone significant changes associated with anthropogenic activities and natural disturbances. These changes have the potential to alter primary productivity and biomass carbon storage. In particular, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in RM streams can affect heterotrophic processes, act as a source for the nutrient cycle, absorb sunlight radiation, alter metal transport, and can promote the production of carcinogenic byproducts during water treatment. Recent studies have focused on the relationship between bark beetle infestations and stream organic matter but have reached conflicting conclusions. Consequently, here we compile and process multiple datasets representing features of the RM for the period 1983–2012 with the purpose of assessing their relative influence on stream DOC concentrations using spatial statistical modeling. Features representing climate, land cover, forest disturbances, topography, soil types, and anthropogenic activities are included. We focus on DOC during base-flow conditions in RM streams because base-flow concentrations are more representative of the longer-term (annual to decadal) impacts and are less dependent on episodic, short-term storm and runoff/erosion events. To predict DOC throughout the network, we use a stream network model in a 56,550 km2 area to address the intrinsic connectivity and hydrologic directionality of the stream network. Natural forest disturbances are positively correlated with increased DOC concentrations; however, the effect of urbanization is far greater. Similarly, higher maximum temperatures, which can be exacerbated by climate change, are also associated with elevated DOC concentrations. Overall, DOC concentrations present an increasing trend over time in the RM region.","Rodríguez-Jeangros, Nicolás;McCray, John E;Hering, Amanda S","Scholarly Journals",2018,10,"2315283266","proquest",5,"PG","DC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"2","continental-scale consequences of tree die-offs in north america: identifying where forest loss matters most","Regional-scale tree die-off events driven by drought and warming and associated pests and pathogens have occurred recently on all forested continents and are projected to increase in frequency and extent with future warming. Within areas where tree mortality has occurred, ecological, hydrological and meteorological consequences are increasingly being documented. However, the potential for tree die-off to impact vegetation processes and related carbon dynamics in areas remote to where die-off occurs has rarely been systematically evaluated, particularly for multiple distinct regions within a given continent. Such remote impacts can occur when climate effects of local vegetation change are propagated by atmospheric circulation—the phenomena of ‘ecoclimate teleconnections’. We simulated tree die-off events in the 13 most densely forested US regions (selected from the 20 US National Ecological Observatory Network [NEON] domains) and found that tree die-off even for smaller regions has potential to affect climate and hence Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) in disparate regions (NEON domains), either positively or negatively. Some regions exhibited strong teleconnections to several others, and some regions were relatively sensitive to tree loss regardless of what other region the tree loss occurred in. For the US as a whole, loss of trees in the Pacific Southwest—an area undergoing rapid tree die-off—had the largest negative impact on remote US GPP whereas loss of trees in the Mid-Atlantic had the largest positive impact. This research lays a foundation for hypotheses that identify how the effects of tree die-off (or other types of tree loss such as deforestation) can ricochet across regions by revealing hot-spots of forcing and response. Such modes of connectivity have direct applicability for improving models of climate change impacts and for developing more informed and coordinated carbon accounting across regions.","Swann, Abigail L S;Laguë, Marysa M;Garcia, Elizabeth S;Field, Jason P;Breshears, David D;Moore, David J P;Saleska, Scott R;Stark, Scott C;Juan Camilo Villegas;Law, Darin J;Minor, David M","Scholarly Journals",2018,13,"2548968852","proquest",12,"PG","CP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"3","ecohydrology in semiarid urban ecosystems; modeling the relationship between connected impervious area and ecosystem productivity","In water-stressed, semiarid urban environments, connections between impervious surfaces and drainage networks may strongly impact the water use and ecosystem productivity of neighboring vegetated areas. We use an ecohydrologic model, the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys), to quantify the sensitivity of vegetation water use and net primary productivity (NPP) to fine-scale impervious surface connectivity. We develop a set of very fine-scale (2 m (super 2) ) scenarios that vary both the percentage of impervious surface and fraction of this impervious surface with direct hydrologic connections to urban drainage systems for a small hillslope. When driven by Mediterranean climate forcing, model estimates suggest that total vegetation water use declines with increasing impervious area. However, when impervious area is hydrologically disconnected from the urban drainage network, declines in water and carbon fluxes with decreased vegetated area can be partially, or in some cases even completely, offset by increased transpiration and NPP in the remaining vegetation. Relative increases in water use and NPP of remaining vegetation are much greater for deeply rooted shrubs and trees and negligible for shallow rooted grasses. We extrapolate our findings to the catchment scale by developing a first-order approximation of fine-scale impervious connection impacts on aggregate watershed water and carbon flux estimates. Our approach offers a computationally and data-efficient method for estimating the impact of impervious area connectivity on these ecohydrologic fluxes. For our only partially urbanized Santa Barbara watershed, estimates of water use and NPP that account for fine-scale impervious connection differed by more than 10% from those that did not.

"4","evaluating controls on the formation and reservoir architecture of niagaran pinnacle reefs (silurian) in the michigan basin; a sequence stratigraphic approach","Silurian-aged (Niagaran) ""pinnacle"" reefs have been productive in the Michigan Basin for 60+ years, but extensive lateral and vertical heterogeneity limits primary production to as little as 25%. Enhanced recovery efforts are generally focused on water and CO (sub 2) floods, or horizontal drilling, but the connectivity of the reefs laterally and vertically is poorly understood and unpredictable, leading to marginal success in many reefs. Niagaran ""pinnacle"" reef growth has previously been described as continuous growth during a single relative sea level rise. In this model, the characteristic shoaling upward sequence varies from a microbial mound facies at the base, with a stromatoporoid-dominated reef core capped by algal laminites and anhydrites that form a regional seal for many of the reefs in the Basin. Detailed core analysis within a sequence stratigraphic framework, however, indicates that the overall shoaling sequence is made up of higher frequency depositional cycles, each bounded by exposure or flooding surfaces. These tens of meters to meter scale cycles support an episodic reef growth model controlled by multiple fluctuations in relative sea level, and provides a means to predict reservoir quality since porosity and permeability is often related to primary facies in these reefs. Because many cycles contain reservoir facies bounded by low permeability units, the result is often significant vertical compartmentalization. This core-based understanding of the episodic nature of ""pinnacle"" reef growth, as well as the vertical facies successions and resulting impact on reservoir heterogeneity, should lead to enhanced predictability of reservoir architecture from wireline log signatures alone.","Sandomierski, Anthony;Grammer, G Michael;Harrison, William E;Anonymous","Scholarly Journals",2006,15,"2364109858","proquest",26,"PG","LY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"5","hydrologic habitat preferences of select southeastern usa fishes resilient to river ecosystem fragmentation","Large-scale habitat preferences of riverine taxa are not always revealed by examining community data. Here, we show how lipid and growth can be used to evaluate hydrologic habitat preferences of fishes resilient to river fragmentation (i.e. species that can tolerate river fragmentation by dams, but not collapse). Lipid content was examined for seven fishes in a major southeastern USA reservoir and its largest lotic tributary over the 5 years. Controlling for effects of sex, size and year of collection, largemouth bass, spotted bass and black crappie had significantly higher lipid in lentic habitat. Conversely, channel catfish and freshwater drum had significantly higher lipid in lotic habitat. There were no significant differences in lipid of bluegill and blacktail shiner between hydrologic habitat types. Fish growth produced concordant results as largemouth bass and spotted bass had significantly faster growth in lentic habitat, whereas channel catfish and freshwater drum had significantly faster growth in lotic habitat. We were also able to document a synchronous spike in lipids of these species in both habitat types during a major drought. We surmise that the spike was driven by enhanced primary production, predator-prey concentration and possibly also reduced reproduction during intense drought. Two conclusions are drawn from this study as a whole. First, long-term lipid and growth observations hold promise for evaluating ecological effects of droughts over long time spans. Second, population characteristics are excellent indicators of habitat preferences and could be used more broadly to elucidate how organisms react to river ecosystem fragmentation and restoration initiatives.

"6","influences of multi-scale habitat on metabolism in a coastal great lakes watershed","Spatial heterogeneity influences ecosystem structure and function across multiple habitat scales. Although primary production and respiration are fundamental to energy cycling in aquatic ecosystems, we know relatively little about how habitat scale influences metabolism. In this study, we adopted a multi-scale habitat approach to evaluate primary production and respiration in a coastal Great Lakes watershed that is experiencing pressure from past, present, and anticipated future human activities. We divided the watershed into five macrohabitats (stream, river, wetland, drowned-river mouth lake, and Great Lake), two mesohabitats (benthic and water column), and four microhabitats (periphytic substrates: sand/sediment, rock, wood, and plant) for evaluation of spatial patterns and synchrony in metabolism. Factors that influenced patterns of metabolism were scale dependent. Algal biomass strongly influenced spatial patterns in metabolism at the meso- and microhabitat scales; greater algal biomass translated to higher areal-specific and lower chlorophyll-specific metabolism at benthic mesohabitat and sand/sediment and rock microhabitats. Benthic metabolism overwhelmed water column metabolism, irrespective of location or time of year. Watershed position was important at the macrohabitat scale, with greater overall metabolism in macrohabitats located lower in the watershed. Average synchrony in metabolism rates was greatest at the macrohabitat scale, suggesting metabolic patterns that are evident at finer scales may become integrated at coarser scales. Our results (1) show that spatial and temporal patterns in metabolism are shaped by factors that are dependent upon habitat scale; (2) highlight the importance of benthic productivity across habitat and season; and (3) suggest that hydrologic connectivity strongly influences ecosystem processes, although physical factors can affect these responses as evidenced by the low levels of synchrony between Lake Michigan and the other macrohabitats.","Ogdahl, Mary E;Lougheed, Vanessa L;Stevenson, RJan;Steinman, Alan D","Scholarly Journals",2010,13,"746300493","proquest",40,"PG","RP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"7","linkages between hydrogeomorphology and nutrient availability in wetlands","Hydrogeomorphology is an important determinant of nutrient transport, cycling, and availability in wetlands. Fluvial geomorphic position in the landscape can influence the connectivity of wetlands to flowing water, thereby affecting the inputs of nutrients to the wetland, and ultimately controlling biogeochemical transformations. Similarly, internal geomorphic heterogeneity (microtopography) can influence soil wetness within the wetland and biogeochemistry. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs and soil biogeochemical transformations were measured across a range of wetland ecosystems, including floodplain wetlands, tidal freshwater wetlands, and created wetlands. Nitrogen and P inputs from sedimentation and inorganic ion loading to the soil surface were greater at locations with greater connectivity to river water. Nutrient inputs from sedimentation also vary across broad landscape gradients from nontidal, tidal freshwater, and tidal oligohaline wetlands. Both N and P mineralization in wetland soils increased with N and P inputs. Thus, greater hydrologic connectivity (as influenced by landscape position and river-wetland geomorphology) stimulates nutrient availability for primary production, other biogeochemical processes, and ecosystem nutrient retention. Furthermore, microtopographic heterogeneity within wetlands stimulated nutrient availability and retention. In tidal freshwater wetlands, hummocks were hotspots of soil nitrification relative to low lying hollows. In created wetlands, building microtopography during construction resulted in greater soil nitrification and denitrification. In conclusion, geomorphology and hydrology at multiple scales influence the inputs, biogeochemical transformations, and availability of nutrients in wetland ecosystems.","Noe, G B;Hupp, C R;Schenk, E;Batson, J;Krauss, K;Ensign, S;Wolf, K;Ahn, C;Anonymous","Scholarly Journals",2013,2013,"2366757336","proquest",47,"PG","CP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"8","patterns of primary and heterotrophic productivity in an arid lowland river","Three river conceptual models make differing predictions about the major source of primary production in lowland rivers, acknowledging the importance of primary productivity in the ecology and management of lowland rivers. Patterns of primary production in lowland rivers are still an area of considerable uncertainty. The objective of this study was to examine the major sources and transformations of organic matter in an Australian lowland river and compare them to the predictions of existing models. The broad approach adopted was to quantify the contribution from the major ecosystem components and compare these with estimates of system metabolism determined using open water measures of diel oxygen change. Three 4-km river reaches were selected to represent the extent of variation found along the free-flowing lowland sections of the Murray River, one of Australia's largest and most regulated rivers. Annual open water gross primary production (GPP) estimates for the Murray R. during this study ranged from 221 to 376 gC m(-2) y(-1) and were similar to other large rivers. Examination of the net contribution of organic matter to the channel indicates that primary productivity in the Murray R. is derived from a combination of phytoplankton, riparian vegetation and macrophytes, but that the major source varies both spatially and temporally. The present study confirms that the River Continuum Concept (RCC), the Flood Pulse Concept (FPC) and Riverine Productivity Model (RPM) all have some application to Australian lowland rivers, but that synthesis of the models will be difficult until we can incorporate the extent, causes and consequences of primary production variability. This study also highlights the importance of the microbial loop and macrophytes in the ecology of the Murray R.

"9","soil bacterial diversity mediated by microscale aqueous-phase processes across biomes","Soil bacterial diversity varies across biomes with potential impacts on soil ecological functioning. Here, we incorporate key factors that affect soil bacterial abundance and diversity across spatial scales into a mechanistic modeling framework considering soil type, carbon inputs and climate towards predicting soil bacterial diversity. The soil aqueous-phase content and connectivity exert strong influence on bacterial diversity for each soil type and rainfall pattern. Biome-specific carbon inputs deduced from net primary productivity provide constraints on soil bacterial abundance independent from diversity. The proposed heuristic model captures observed global trends of bacterial diversity in good agreement with predictions by an individual-based mechanistic model. Bacterial diversity is highest at intermediate water contents where the aqueous phase forms numerous disconnected habitats and soil carrying capacity determines level of occupancy. The framework delineates global soil bacterial diversity hotspots; located mainly in climatic transition zones that are sensitive to potential climate and land use changes. Numerous micro- and macro-scale factors influence soil microbial diversity. Here the authors create a model to demonstrate that fine scale soil moisture influences the carrying capacity of microbes, which then scales up to larger biogeographic patterns.","Bickel, Samuel;Or Dani","Scholarly Journals",2020,11,"2342970499","proquest",61,"PG","MB",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"10","the impact of surface water exchange on the nutrient and particle dynamics in side-arms along the river danube, austria","Results of two monitoring programs obtained in the free-flowing section of the Danube downstream of Vienna were used to evaluate the effects of river restoration designed to increase surface water inputs into side-arms. Functional descriptors like hydrochemical parameters and plankton react immediately to restored hydrological conditions and offer the opportunity to elucidate the hydrological control on organic processing as an important ecosystem function in fluvial landscapes. Two hydraulic parameters were estimated and linked to basic ecological properties. The level of hydrological connectivity was defined as the average annual duration (days per year) of upstream surface connection and can be used as a 'simple to estimate' parameter within the planning phase. Water age, an adapted measure of residence time based on more detailed information, allow description of the temporal development in side-arms. Greater hydrological connectivity leads to lower conductivity levels and increased nutrient concentrations due to the shift of the dominating source to river water. The contribution of river flow is indicated by higher suspended solid concentrations in side-arms than disconnected water bodies. The phytoplankton biomass shows the highest mean values at a duration of integration of 1 month a super(-1) and decrease with increasing connectivity. The relationships point to a more 'main channel like' hydrochemical situation in the side-arms, with a medium level of phytoplankton biomass and increased autochthonous carbon export. No evidence of eutrophication was found due to the shift of the side-arm from an organic matter sink to a source. On a more detailed level, water age demonstrates the temporal patterns of riverine input, the development of plankton production and the shift between hydrological and biological control of phytoplankton vs. riverine flow in a side-arm. The hydrologic parameters were useful predictors for evaluating the effects of restoration measures in river floodplain systems.","Hein, T;Baranyi, C;Reckendorfer, W;Schiemer, F","Scholarly Journals",2004,328,"19813001","proquest",68,"PG","DC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"11","use of ndvi and landscape metrics to assess effects of riverine inputs on wetland productivity and stability","Alterations to Louisiana's river systems and local hydrology have resulted in reduced freshwater, sediment, and nutrient inputs to wetland landscapes, causing significant negative impacts on marsh productivity and stability. This study set out to assess regional- and basin-scale impacts of river connectivity and sediment availability on wetland productivity. Satellite data were used in conjunction with river discharge, river sediment concentration, and wetland accretion data to evaluate correlations between river connectivity and wetland productivity and stability. Significant correlations were observed between river connectivity and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Aggregation Index (AI) values across a 10 year period of analysis. Moderate correlations (r(2) = 0.51) between mean NDVI and AI values were observed for all wetland vegetation in coastal Louisiana. Middle Coast wetlands had the highest river connectivity and significantly higher aboveground productivity, spatial integrity, and wetland area. The Chenier Plain, with moderate sediment and nutrient inputs, consisted primarily of moderate productivity and integrity. The majority of the inactive Deltaic Plain, which is largely sediment deprived, consists of landscapes with the lowest wetland productivity and spatial integrity. This study linked wetland area, configuration, and productivity with river connectivity to provide an enhanced understanding of river and sediment importance for wetland stability and restoration.","Suir, Glenn M.; Sasser, Charles E.","Scholarly Journals",2019,39,"BIOSIS:PREV201900873918","wos",75,"PG","DC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"30","how do hydrogeological setting and meteorological conditions influence water table depth and fluctuations in ombrotrophic peatlands?","Peatlands are wetland ecosystems where net primary production exceeds organic matter decomposition. They are characterized by a near-surface water table controlled by a combination of internal and external processes, influenced by short-term meteorological and long-term climate variations among other factors. Site-specific conditions, such as peat hydrodynamic properties, surface vegetation patterns, and hydrogeological setting also substantially influence water table dynamics. The objective of this work was to characterize the influence of hydrogeological setting and meteorological conditions on water table depths (WTD) and on fluctuations therein in seven ombrotrophic peatlands in or near the St. Lawrence Lowlands (southern Quebec, Canada). Up-gradient, mid-gradient, and down-gradient locations were monitored in the seven peatlands, using dipwells with hourly WTD recordings. WTD was also monitored in the marginal minerotrophic zone found in three of the seven peatlands. Additionally, heads in the outflow (i.e., receiving diffused water from the peatland) and inflow (i.e., providing diffused water to the peatland) zones within the adjacent mineral deposits were monitored in seven and three peatlands respectively, using piezometers with hourly hydraulic head recordings. Hydraulic conductivities for the outflow zones ranged between 1.4*10(-7) and 8.5*10(-3) cm/s, whereas those of the inflow zones ranged between 5.6*10(-7) and 3.9*10(-6) cm/s. Evapotranspiration was shown to be the dominant factor controlling monthly cumulative water table decreases (MCD), while precipitation dominated the monthly cumulative water table increases (MCI). A strong correlation was found between mean peatland WTD and outflow zone hydraulic conductivity. Peatlands that were identified as being strongly connected with the adjacent mineral deposits in a diffuse underground outflow zone showed the greatest variations in water storage. This study highlights the importance of the connection between peatlands and adjacent mineral deposits in controlling WTD, as found for those located in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. The results show that water table fluctuations are strongly controlled by meteorological conditions, and that hydrogeological setting exerts a strong control on MCI and MCD. Moreover, this work shows that WTD in ombrotrophic peatlands is influenced by the hydraulic conductivity of the outflow zones, and confirms that aquifer - peatland connectivity influences peatland water storage variations, and therefore peatland vulnerability to disturbances in aquifer groundwater levels.","Bourgault, Marc-Andre; Larocque, Marie; Garneau, Michelle","Scholarly Journals",2019,4,"BIOSIS:PREV202100649773","wos",30,"CP","PG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"47","linkages among aquatic ecosystems","Aquatic ecosystems are almost invariably connected to other ecosystems because the dominant force of water movement facilitates physical, chemical, and biological exchanges among ecosystems In this sense, we define an ecosystem linkage as any persistent or recurring process or attribute that connects different ecosystems in some manner. We argue that such linkages are integral, even defining, components of aquatic ecosystem structure and function, and therefore, Should be evaluated in the Course of ecological Studies J-NABS has made significant contributions to our understanding of such linkages The percentage of all publications in J-NABS addressing some ecological linkage has approached 10% in recent years. Historically, emphasis was placed on upstream-downstream linkages in flowing waters, and theory (e.g, river continuum, nutrient spiraling) has evolved largely around this phenomenon However, other linkages among ecosystems have received increased attention in the past 20 y These linkages include surface-subsurface, lake-stream, river-floodplain, and, more recently, marine-freshwater. We contend that many ecological processes, Including primary production, nutrient cycling, organic matter processing, and secondary production, are driven by Such exchanges because of the donor-controlled nature of many aquatic ecosystems Exchanges of materials from aquatic ecosystems to terrestrial systems, caused by flooding, nutrient translocation, or insect emergence, can be substantial Movement of energy and nutrients from the ocean to freshwaters, such as in the migrations of anadromous fishes, also can be dramatic Despite increasing evidence of the importance Of Such linkages, considerable impediments to research, Such as Journal specialization, lack of interdisciplinary study teams, and limited funding of sufficient duration for Such research, exist. Such obstacles are surmount able if investigators continue to emphasize that aquatic ecology will be advanced by the study of such linkages, and that environmental problems are better understood and solved in the context of that knowledge.","Lamberti, Gary A.; Chaloner, Dominic T.; Hershey, Anne E.","Scholarly Journals",2010,29,"BIOSIS:PREV201000197689","wos",45,"LY","PG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"69","temperature and precipitation drive temporal variability in aquatic carbon and ghg concentrations and fluxes in a peatland catchment","The aquatic pathway is increasingly being recognized as an important component of catchment carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets, particularly in peatland systems due to their large carbon store and strong hydrological connectivity. In this study, we present a complete 5-year data set of all aquatic carbon and GHG species from an ombrotrophic Scottish peatland. Measured species include particulate and dissolved forms of organic carbon (POC, DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2, CH4 and N2O. We show that short-term variability in concentrations exists across all species and this is strongly linked to discharge. Seasonal cyclicity was only evident in DOC,CO2 and CH4 concentration; however, temperature correlated with monthly means in all species except DIC. Although the temperature correlation with monthly DOC and POC concentrations appeared to be related to biological productivity in the terrestrial system, we suggest the temperature correlation with CO2 and CH4 was primarily due to in-stream temperature-dependent solubility. Interannual variability in total aquatic carbon concentration was strongly correlated with catchment gross primary productivity (GPP) indicating a strong potential terrestrial aquatic linkage. DOC represented the largest aquatic carbon flux term (19.3 plus or minus 4.59 g C m-2 yr-1), followed by CO2 evasion (10.0 g C m-2 yr-1). Despite an estimated contribution to the total aquatic carbon flux of between 8 and 48%, evasion estimates had the greatest uncertainty. Interannual variability in total aquatic carbon export was low in comparison with variability in terrestrial biosphere-atmosphere exchange, and could be explained primarily by temperature and precipitation. Our results therefore suggest that climatic change is likely to have a significant impact on annual carbon losses through the aquatic pathway, and as such, aquatic exports are fundamental to the understanding of whole catchment responses to climate change.","Dinsmore, K J;Billett, M F;Dyson, KE","Scholarly Journals",2013,19,"1372057943","proquest",64,"MB","PG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
