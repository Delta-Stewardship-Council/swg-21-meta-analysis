"1","biogeochemistry of carbon in the amazonian floodplains over a 2000-km reach: insights from a process-based model","The influence of Amazonian floodplains on the hydrological, sedimentary, and biogeochemical river budget was investigated over a 2000-km reach. A process-based model relying on the closure of chemical fluxes and isotopic signals was implemented. On average for the whole studied reach, the overall fluxes of carbon associated with mineralization and aquatic photosynthesis were estimated to 35.7 and 15.3 Tg C yr -1 , respectively. Almost 57% of the carbon sequestrated by photosynthesis comes from aerial sources (flooded forest); the remaining 43% resulted from aquatic sources (várzea grasses and phytoplankton). The process rates substantially fluctuate over the annual cycle, depending particularly on the extension of flooded area and on the river-floodplain connectivity. As the river level declines, the drastic decrease of turbidity and the lower supply of carbon substrates promote autotrophy to the detriment of heterotrophy, leading to substantial changes of pH and gaseous equilibria in the river water. The main consequences are (i) the side-chain oxidation of dissolved organic matter leading to the concomitant rises of the carbon to nitrogen atomic ratio and nitrate contents and (ii) the sorption of hydrophobic humic acids, which fractionate 13 C and thus lead to 13 C-depleted particulate organic matter (fine fraction) compared to remaining dissolved organic matter. As the river flow rises, the heterotrophy prevails over autotrophy and this tends to attenuate the chemical signature imprinted by the latter. The significant contribution of aerial autochthonous sources to the budget of carbon indicates that the fluxes of mineralization are sustained by the net primary production of river corridors. The variable extension of submerged areas defines the proportions of CO 2 exported by the river and released to the atmosphere. The rate of CO 2 outgassing on the studied reach (18.8 Tg C yr -1 ) represents about 50% of the incoming dissolved inorganic carbon flux. The rate of methane emission is estimated as 2.2 Tg C yr -1 and that of denitrification is estimated as 0.87 Tg N yr -1 , representing 1.5 times the flux of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) exported by the Amazon River at the station of Óbidos (0.64 Tg N yr -1 ).","Jose Mauro Sousa de Moura,@ Daniel de Castro Victoria,&amp; Andre Marcondes Andrade Toledo,, Vincent;Colicchio++, Erich","Scholarly Journals",2011,15,"851503725","proquest",7,"RP","PG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"2","development, maintenance and role of riparian vegetation in the river landscape","Functional zones were characterised (with respect to vegetation development in association with various biogeochemical processes) within geomorphological settings using a delineation based upon erosional, transitional and depositional properties. Vegetation dynamics within the riparian corridor are clearly influenced substantially by hydrological disturbance regimes. In turn, it is suggested that vegetation productivity and diversity may widely influence riverine biogeochemical processes, especially as related to the consequences of changing redox conditions occurring from upstream to downstream. However, surface and ground linkages are the predominant controls of landscape connectivity within riparian systems. The importance of riparian zones as sources and sinks of matter and energy was examined in context of structural and functional attributes, such as sequestering or cycling of nutrients in sediments, retention of water in vegetation, and retention, diffusion or dispersal of biota. The consequences of interactions between different communities on biogeochemical processes are notably in need of research, especially with respect to control of landscape features.","Tabacchi, E;Correll, D L;Hauer, R;Pinay, G;Planty-Tabacchi, A-M;Wissmar, R C","Scholarly Journals",1998,40,"17330580","proquest",14,"RP","CP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"3","ecosystem metabolism of benthic and pelagic zones of a shallow productive estuary: spatio-temporal variability","Long-term deterioration of water quality is known to reduce the importance of benthic ecosystem metabolism in shallow coastal ecosystems, but drivers of spatial and short-term variability in ecosystem metabolism are poorly understood. We addressed this knowledge gap through detailed seasonal measurements of ecosystem metabolism across depth gradients from shallow (2 to 3 m) eelgrass-dominated to deeper (4 to 5 m) muddy regions of a shallow, productive estuary. Combined measurements of gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R) and, by difference, net ecosystem production (NEP) by the open-water diel oxygen technique and in situ chamber incubations showed high importance of shallow eelgrass habitats for metabolism at the system scale. Seasonal variations in GPP, R and NEP increased with light availability and temperature with highest NEP in all habitats during the warm and sunny mid-summer. The shallow eelgrass-dominated and neighboring habitats were seasonally net autotrophic (NEP = 0.54 and 0.31 mg O 2 m -2 d -1 , respectively), compared to net heterotrophy (NEP = -0.26 mg O 2 m -2 d -1 ) at the deeper muddy site. Detailed studies along depth gradients further confirmed the role of eelgrass as a key driver of spatial differences in ecosystem metabolism across the estuary. Strong northerly winds (&gt;8 m s -1 ) caused short-term (&lt;24 h) periods of similar oxygen dynamics and similar apparent productivity in shallow and deeper waters, indicative of efficient lateral mixing, while calm periods (&lt;4 m s -1 ) enabled formation of ‘pockets’, i.e. water masses with limited connectivity, which exacerbated the metabolic differences between shallow and deep sites.","Staehr, Peter A;Asmala, Eero;Carstensen, Jacob;Krause-Jensen, Dorte;Reader, Heather","Scholarly Journals",2018,601,"2100381185","proquest",21,"RP","LY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"4","genetic diversity and connectivity of deep-sea hydrothermal vent metapopulations","AbstractDeep-sea hydrothermal vents provide ephemeral habitats for animal communities that depend on chemosynthetic primary production. Sporadic volcanic and tectonic events destroy local vent fields and create new ones. Ongoing dispersal and cycles of extirpation and colonization affect the levels and distribution of genetic diversity in vent metapopulations. Several species exhibit evidence for stepping-stone dispersal along relatively linear, oceanic, ridge axes. Other species exhibit very high rates of gene flow, although natural barriers associated with variation in depth, deep-ocean currents, and lateral offsets of ridge axes often subdivide populations. Various degrees of impedance to dispersal across such boundaries are products of species-specific life histories and behaviours. Though unrelated to the size of a species range, levels of genetic diversity appear to correspond with the number of active vent localities that a species occupies within its range. Pioneer species that rapidly colonize nascent vents tend to be less subdivided and more diverse genetically than species that are slow to establish colonies at vents. Understanding the diversity and connectivity of vent metapopulations provides essential information for designing deep-sea preserves in regions that are under consideration for submarine mining of precious metals.","VRIJENHOEK, ROBERT C","Scholarly Journals",2010,19,"853471072","proquest",28,"RP","ES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"5","hydrological connectivity drives patterns of macroinvertebrate biodiversity in floodplain rivers of the australian wet /dry tropics","1. Floodplain rivers in Australia's wet/dry tropics are regarded as being among the most ecologically intact and bio-diverse lotic ecosystems in the world, yet there have been relatively few community-based studies of their aquatic fauna. 2. To investigate relationships between hydrological connectivity and biodiversity in the region, macroinvertebrates were collected from sites within two contrasting floodplain rivers, the 'tropical' Gregory River and 'dryland' Flinders River systems, during the dry season and analysed at various spatial scales. A subset of sites was re-sampled in the following dry season to explore temporal variation. The fauna consisted of 124 morphotaxa, dominated by gatherers and the Insecta. 3. As predicted, hydrological connectivity (the lotic or lentic status of waterbodies) had a major influence on macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and diversity, both in space and time. Assemblages from waterbodies with similar connection histories were most alike, and beta-diversity between assemblages was greatest between lotic and lentic waterbodies, tending to increase with increasing spatial separation. 4. At smaller spatial scales, a number of within-waterbody, habitat and water quality characteristics were important for explaining variation (61%) in the taxonomic organization of assemblages, and characteristics associated with primary productivity and habitat diversity were important for explaining variation (45%) in the functional organization of assemblages. However, much of the small-scale environmental variation across the study region appeared to be related to broad-scale variation in hydrological connectivity, which had both direct and indirect effects on macroinvertebrate assemblages. 5. Conservation of the biodiversity in Australia's wet/dry tropics may depend on conserving the natural variation in hydrological connectivity and the unregulated flow of floodplain rivers.","Leigh, Catherine;Sheldon, Fran","Scholarly Journals",2009,54,"46164494","proquest",35,"RP","DC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"6","is net ecosystem production higher in natural relative to constructed wetlands?","Ecosystem metabolism is an important measure of wetland restoration efficiency, and serves to indicate if the system is capable of processing energetic resources. Despite its value, ecosystem metabolism has rarely been included in monitoring programs. In this study, we aimed to achieve the following objectives: (i) compare net ecosystem production (NEP) rates of constructed vs. natural wetlands; (ii) identify the highest NEP rate habitats; and (iii) define the main environmental factors regulating NEP in different wetland types. Pelagic and benthic NEP rates and physicochemical features were measured in three natural and five constructed wetlands in the middle Ebro River floodplain (NE Spain). Statistical analyses showed pelagic NEP rates peaked in natural wetlands, which produced up to 187.5 mg C m(-3) h(-1) compared to lower rates in constructed wetlands (up to 46.2 mg C m(-3) h(-1)). Pelagic NEP responded positively to temperature, total dissolved solids, and nutrients. Benthic NEP rates were 3 to 30-fold greater than pelagic in natural (up to 994.9 mg C m(-3) h(-1)) and constructed (up to 1,551.5 mg C m(-3) h(-1)) wetlands, and were heavily influenced by habitat type, with NEP peaking in areas dominated by submerged vegetation and fine organic sediment. Rapid recovery in aquatic communities (i. e. macroinvertebrate diversity) has been previously reported for the studied wetlands; however, our study suggests a slower recovery of functional processes (i.e. pelagic NEP) in constructed habitats. We therefore strongly advocate the inclusion of ecosystem function in the design and evaluation of restoration projects to optimise long-term wetland ecosystem sustainability.","Espanol, Cecilia; Gallardo, Belinda; Rosa Pino, M.; Martin, Ana; Comin, Francisco A.","Scholarly Journals",2013,75,"BIOSIS:PREV201300666722","wos",42,"RP","PG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"7","longitudinal spatial variation in ecological conditions in an in-channel floodplain river system during flow pulses","A field survey was conducted during flow pulses to investigate the longitudinal spatial patterns in water quality, dissolved inorganic and organic matter, phytoplankton, planktonic bacteria, zooplankton, gross primary productivity (GPP) of phytoplankton and planktonic respiration (PR) in channels of the large floodplain system (˜¼124 km in length) of the Macquarie Marshes, south-eastern Australia. Four river reaches (areas) with distinct hydrogeomorphological characteristics within the distributary zone of the lower Macquarie River were chosen for analysis of abiotic and biotic variables in their in-stream environments. The results showed marked longitudinal spatial variation in the values within and among the measured environmental variables including such functional aspects as primary productivity and PR. The variables that tended to have increasing values in a downstream direction were conductivity, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), dissolved silica, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP), ratio of DOC/DON and counts of planktonic bacteria. Conversely, the values that tended to decrease downstream were the ratios of TN/TP, DIN/DRP, DOC/DOP, DON/DOP and GPP/PR. Variables that had a localized peak(s) were dissolved oxygen, turbidity, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, GPP, PR and counts of cyanobacteria, diatoms, green algae, cryptomonads, protozoans, rotifers, copepods and cladocerans. Overall, two distinct ecological zones were identified within the broader distributary functional process zone (FPZ): these being the upstream zone with relatively high levels of DO, turbidity, diatoms and GPP/PR ratio, and the downstream zone with relatively high levels of nutrients, dissolved organic matter, cyanobacteria, planktonic bacteria, protozoans and cladocerans. The results of this study describe the spatial connectivity of ecological processes related to hydrogeomorphological factors within a FPZ of a riverine ecosystem, and support the predictions of the riverine ecosystem synthesis framework that ecological patterns and processes can be discontinuous on a longitudinal spatial scale.

"8","phytoplankton dynamics in relation to connectivity, flow dynamics and resource availability the case of a large, lowland river, the hungarian tisza","Large lowland rivers with sufficient hydrological storage capacity are capable of supporting primary production, but the dynamics of the advecting phytoplankton is poorly understood. Our study aimed at exploring how longitudinal versus lateral connectivity, flow dynamics versus resource availability and continuous versus discontinuous environmental gradients shaped the species composition of phytoplankton. Samples were taken from February to October 2000 along the Hungarian Tisza River (HTR) and in its main tributaries. Longitudinal and seasonal patterns were related to resources (light and nutrients) availability and flow dynamics derived from a 1D hydrodynamic model. The HTR was autotrophic during the study period, but tributary input considerably exceeded net autochtonous production. The Szamos River was the major source of both phytoplankton and nutrients in the HTR. Chryso- and euglenophytes were flushed into the main river from floodplain oxbows during high discharge. Imported algae experienced discontinuity in environmental gradients when entering the main river. The merged impact areas of two dams (IAD) that separate the two large meandering patches of the HTR disrupted the longitudinal profiles of both physico-chemical variables and attributes of algal assemblages (biomass, species composition, richness, similarity between adjacent sampling sites). Hydraulic storage along the IAD selectively favoured the recruitment of cryptophytes that, however, could not compensate for the enhanced sedimentation of diatoms in terms of biomass. Although the meandering patches presented several small-scale differences in major environmental gradients, both patches supported the growth of planktonic diatoms. Changes in algal biomass were decoupled from nutrient availability. We conclude that various measures must be applied in various lowland rivers within the same catchment to control their trophic status as a component of the 'good ecological status' defined in the Water Framework Directive.","Istvánovics, Vera;Honti, Márk;VÃ¶rÃ¶s, Lajos;Kozma, Zsolt","Scholarly Journals",2010,637,"46458940","proquest",56,"RP","ES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"9","spatial patterns of fish communities along two estuarine gradients in southern florida","Issue Title: Theme: Interaction of Hydrology and Nutrients in Controlling Ecosystem Function in Oligotrophic Coastal Environments of South Florida In tropical and subtropical estuaries, gradients of primary productivity and salinity are generally invoked to explain patterns in community structure and standing crops of fishes. We documented spatial and temporal patterns in fish community structure and standing crops along salinity and nutrient gradients in two subtropical drainages of Everglades National Park, USA. The Shark River drains into the Gulf of Mexico and experiences diurnal tides carrying relatively nutrient enriched waters, while Taylor River is more hydrologically isolated by the oligohaline Florida Bay and experiences no discernable lunar tides. We hypothesized that the more nutrient enriched system would support higher standing crops of fishes in its mangrove zone. We collected 50 species of fish from January 2000 to April 2004 at six sampling sites spanning fresh to brackish salinities in both the Shark and Taylor River drainages. Contrary to expectations, we observed lower standing crops and density of fishes in the more nutrient rich tidal mangrove forest of the Shark River than in the less nutrient rich mangrove habitats bordering the Taylor River. Tidal mangrove habitats in the Shark River were dominated by salt-tolerant fish and displayed lower species richness than mangrove communities in the Taylor River, which included more freshwater taxa and yielded relatively higher richness. These differences were maintained even after controlling for salinity at the time of sampling. Small-scale topographic relief differs between these two systems, possibly created by tidal action in the Shark River. We propose that this difference in topography limits movement of fishes from upstream marshes into the fringing mangrove forest in the Shark River system, but not the Taylor River system. Understanding the influence of habitat structure, including connectivity, on aquatic communities is important to anticipate effects of construction and operational alternatives associated with restoration of the Everglades ecosystem.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","Green, David P; J;Trexler, Joel C;Lorenz, Jerome J;Mcivor, Carole C;Philippi, Tom","Scholarly Journals",2006,569,"821258614","proquest",63,"RP","CP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"10","the role of hydrologic connections between impervious surfaces and vegetated patches in semi-arid urban environments","Urban environments are characterized by fine-scale heterogeneity, with patches of impervious surface and vegetation. In semi-arid regions where precipitation patterns are episodic, this fine scale structure may be a significant control on both storm-event runoff and seasonal water yields. From an ecological perspective, the productivity of urban vegetated patches is often limited by available water or is supported by irrigation inputs. Hydrologic connections between fine-scale impervious-surfaces and urban vegetation may influence not only runoff but also useable water for urban vegetation. Semi-arid natural ecosystems are also often characterized by fine scale vegetated - bare soil patch structures and hydrologic connections between these patches has been shown to be a significant control on shrub and forest productivity. In this paper we use an ecohydrologic model, RHESSys, to quantify the sensitivity of vegetation water use, net primary productivity and runoff to fine scale impervious surface connections in a semi arid urban settings. We use simulations on a theoretical hillslope where we can systematically vary impervious surface-vegetation fractions as well as connectivity between these patches to examine sensitivity of runoff, vegetation water use and productivity for a range of semi-arid climate forcing. We combine this analysis with watershed scale models for sites in Santa Barbara and San Diego, California to develop a first-order approximation of the potential impact of accounting for fine scale impervious connections on aggregate watershed ecohydrologic flux estimates. Results indicate that while large increases in impervious surfaces will reduce transpiration and photosynthesis, due to the sheer loss of vegetated area, the effect of decreased vegetated area can be partially or in some cases even completely offset by increased transpiration and productivity in the remaining vegetation that occurs when water is routed from impervious to vegetated areas. These results highlight the importance of accounting for fine-scale heterogeneity and hydrologic connections between patches. We conclude by presenting a modelling framework that can be used to account for these interactions.","Tague, Christina;Shields, Catherine;Anonymous","Scholarly Journals",2012,44,"2366211105","proquest",70,"RP","MB",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"11","woody plant encroachment has a larger impact than climate change on dryland water budgets","Woody plant encroachment (WPE) into grasslands is a global phenomenon that is associated with land degradation via xerification, which replaces grasses with shrubs and bare soil patches. It remains uncertain how the global processes of WPE and climate change may combine to impact water availability for ecosystems. Using a process-based model constrained by watershed observations, our results suggest that both xerification and climate change augment groundwater recharge by increasing channel transmission losses at the expense of plant available water. Conversion from grasslands to shrublands without creating additional bare soil, however, reduces transmission losses. Model simulations considering both WPE and climate change are used to assess their relative roles in a late 21st century condition. Results indicate that changes in focused channel recharge are determined primarily by the WPE pathway. As a result, WPE should be given consideration when assessing the vulnerability of groundwater aquifers to climate change.","Schreiner-McGraw, Adam P;Vivoni, Enrique R;Ajami, Hoori;Sala, Osvaldo E;Throop, Heather L;Peters, Debra P C","Scholarly Journals",2020,10,"2404048751","proquest",77,"RP","ES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"75","the influence of fluctuating ramping rates on the food web of boreal rivers","A BAC delta (before-after-control-impact) sampling design was applied to determine the possible effects of ramping rate (RR) regulation on food webs structure and function in a regulated boreal river. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures of primary producers, macroinvertebrates and fish to determine variations in the source of carbon fuelling the food web as well as changes in the food web structure under variable RR flow regime. We hypothesized that unrestricted RR would (1) increase the connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic environments allowing for a higher contribution of terrestrial carbon to support the food web and (2) decrease food web length because of frequent disturbances. Unrestricted RR had little influence on 13C values for the overall food web with most of the differences found between impacted sites compared and control sites, indicating that the proportion of various carbon sources entering the diet of consumers remained unchanged under unrestricted RR. In contrast, significantly higher 15N values were measured in impacted sites (invertebrates and fish) and as well as under unrestricted ramping flow regime (invertebrates). Further, unrestricted RR was associated to a significant decrease in the difference between macroinvertebrates and fish 15N signatures, equivalent to a reduction of the length of the food web by at least one trophic level. Results from this study indicate that RR should be taken into consideration in the regulation of operating regimes on rivers.","Marty, Jerome;Smokorowski, Karen;Power, Michael","Scholarly Journals",2009,25,"21066393","proquest",69,"ES","RP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"25","environmental factors affecting incorporation of terrestrial material into large river food webs","Three enduring conceptual models make predictions regarding the basal production sources supporting the upper food web of rivers: the River Continuum Concept, the Flood Pulse Concept, and the Riverine Productivity Model. Sources of primary production supporting metazoan biomass might best be understood by using a pluralistic approach that views basal sources as a dependent variable and key physicochemical and hydrological factors as independent variables. Here, I review studies in which chemical markers (stable-isotope and fatty-acid analyses) were used to estimate dominant primary producers contributing to consumer biomass in large rivers and evaluate associated independent variables (e.g., hydrologic regime, turbidity, concentration of dissolved organic matter, floodplain vegetation, lateral connectivity, and upstream impoundment) that have been hypothesized to contribute to variation in basal production sources. My review shows that C₄ grasses rarely support riverine metazoans and that algae are the predominant source of C supporting upper trophic levels of large rivers worldwide. However, I also found that many consumers assimilate material from C(3) plants in rivers with high sediment loads and low transparency during high-flow pulses. Exceptions to this pattern occur when river reaches are downstream from an impoundment, in which case, algae assume greater importance. Terrestrial C(3) plants also subsidize consumers in rivers with high dissolved organic matter concentrations via the microbial loop and, in other rivers, after periods of high discharge or leaf fall that increase the amount of terrestrial material in the particulate organic matter pool. I highlight the natural causes of differences in turbidity and dissolved organic matter among large rivers and the importance of transported materials as a source of nutrients for ecologically and economically important fish species.","Roach, Katherine A","Scholarly Journals",2013,32,"1753433423","proquest",25,"DC","RP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
