"1","20-years cumulative impact from shrimp farming on mangroves of northeast brazil","Brazilian mangroves cover about 11,100 km(2) and provide a wide range of ecosystem services. Despite their importance, they are one of the most impacted ecosystems because of combined influences of climate change, pollution, and direct conversion and loss. A major driver of environmental impacts is shrimp farming and this is particularly acute in the semi-arid northeast of Brazil, where mangroves are constrained in a narrow band along ephemeral estuaries that are often impacted by multi-year droughts. Recent changes to Brazilian law, in particular the Forest Code, have weakened protection for mangroves and associated apicum (salt pan) ecosystems. In NE Brazil, most shrimp ponds are converted from mangrove-adjacent apicuns rather than the mangroves themselves with periodic hydrological connectivity through dammed channels, allowing the flushing of effluents. As a result, the main impacts on mangroves are typically indirect, because of pollution inputs from shrimp pond effluents and associated loss of ecosystem services including reductions in primary productivity, carbon storage capacity, resilience to other environmental stressors, their efficiency as estuarine filters, and biodiversity and abundance of subsistence use of marine species. Soil damage and infrastructure remaining after shrimp pond deactivation impairs mangrove recovery. This extends the duration of the damage and allows the occupation of degraded areas by other activities that can permanently impair ecosystem function. In this review, we address several aspects of the shrimp culture boom in NE Brazilian, their features and consequences, and the future of mangroves in the region considering climate change and rising poverty. Our conclusions on the practices and outcomes of shrimp farming in mangroves are likely to apply to areas with similar environmental settings, e.g., semiarid regions worldwide, and particularly in the Latin America and Caribbean region, and our findings can be taken into account to improve conservation and management of these forests at the least to a regional scale.","de Lacerda, Luiz Drude; Ward, Raymond D.; Godoy, Mario Duarte Pinto; de Andrade Meireles, Antonio Jeovah; Borges, Rebecca; Ferreira, Alexander Cesar","Scholarly Journals",2021,4,"BIOSIS:PREV202100542455","wos",1,"MB","ES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"2","bird rookery nutrient over-enrichment as a potential accelerant of mangrove cay decline in belize","Coastal eutrophication is an issue of serious global concern and although nutrient subsidies can enhance primary productivity of coastal wetlands, they can be detrimental to their long-term maintenance. By supplying nutrients to coastal ecosystems at levels comparable to intensive agriculture practices, roosting colonial waterbirds provide a natural experimental design to examine the impacts of anthropogenic nutrient enrichment in these systems. We tested the hypothesis that long-term nutrient enrichment from bird guano deposition is linked to declines in island size, which may subsequently decrease the stability and resilience of mangrove cays in Belize. We combined remote sensing analysis with field- and lab-based measurements of forest structure, sediment nutrients, and porewater nutrients on three pairs of rookery and control cays in northern, central, and southern Belize. Our results indicate that rookery cays are disappearing approximately 13 times faster than cays without seasonal or resident seabird populations. Rookery cays were associated with a significantly higher concentration of nitrogen (N) in mangrove leaves and greater aboveground biomass, suggesting that eutrophication from bird guano contributes to increased aboveground productivity. Sediments of rookery cays also had lower percentages of soil organic matter and total N and carbon (C) than control islands, which suggests that eutrophication accelerates organic matter decomposition resulting in lower total C stocks on rookery cays. Our results indicate that coastal eutrophication can reduce ecosystem stability by contributing to accelerated cay loss, with potential consequences for mangrove resilience to environmental variability under contemporary and future climatic scenarios.","Simpson, L T;Canty, S W J;Cissell, J R;Steinberg, M K;Cherry, J A;Feller, I C","Scholarly Journals",2021,197,"2580694638","proquest",8,"MB","CP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"3","diel cycles of delta c-13(dic) and ecosystem metabolism in ephemeral dryland streams","Streams in hot, arid environments often exist as a series of isolated pools along main channels. During these periods, shallow alluvial through flow may strongly influence key ecological processes within pools. We measured diel changes in delta C-13 values of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) in two pools of ephemeral, dryland streams. We quantified alluvial water connectivity through stable isotope analysis (delta O-18 and delta H-2) of pool and alluvial water. We also estimated gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) rates across a wider set of pools in both streams. delta C-13(DIC) values displayed regular diel cycles, where both pools displayed small but similar daily amplitude (0.7-0.9 parts per thousand) despite contrasting amplitudes of change in DO (0.8 mg L-1 vs. 2.8 mg L-1) and contrasting alluvial water connectivity (connected vs. disconnected). Water temperature was the strongest predictor of both delta C-13(DIC) values and rates of change in delta C-13(DIC) across both pools. Across both streams, all pools were net heterotrophic. GPP (0.35-1.73 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) and ER (0.49-2.64 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) rates were linked to aquatic vegetation cover. The disconnect between diurnal amplitudes of delta C-13 values and DO concentrations thus suggests that ecological drivers of gas exchange became increasingly localised as pools contracted.","Siebers, Andre R.; Pettit, Neil E.; Skrzypek, Grzegorz; Dogramaci, Shawan; Grierson, Pauline F.","Scholarly Journals",2020,82,"BIOSIS:PREV202000335114","wos",15,"MB","CP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"4","effect of hydrological connectivity on the phosphorus buffering capacity of an urban floodplain","Floodplains can perform nutrient buffering functions and therefore influence the riverine nutrient dynamics depending on the extent of the hydrological connectivity. This work focused on quantifying the adsorption/desorption potential of a degraded floodplain of the Danube River (Lower Lobau) based on sediment characterization (grain size distribution, organic content, and P-fractions) and sediment type-specific P-adsorption via batch experiments. We established an adsorption/desorption budget model with a high temporal and spatial resolution. With this model, we identified spatial patterns related to hydrology and calculated the phosphorus buffering capacity of permanent and temporary floodplain water bodies. Sediment characteristics were defined by the distance to the inflow area and the hydrological connectivity of the floodplain water bodies. The main factor for the concentration of total phosphorus (Ptot) in the sediments was the grain size distribution. Ptot was ten times higher in silt-dominated sediments compared to gravel-dominated sediments. Inorganic phosphorus (Pinorg) ranged between 36 and 90% depending on the organic content of the sediments. Both the adsorption and the desorption potential of SRP (soluble reactive phosphorus) were highest in large, frequently connected water bodies and were strongly controlled by hydrology. The total adsorption potential of the floodplain was up to 40 times higher in wet years (e.g., 2002) than in dry years (e.g., 2003), when floodplain water bodies were connected less frequently to the main channel of the Danube. Up to 75% of the adsorbed SRP was desorbed and released into the water column after periods of connection. Consequently, SRP adsorption directly reduced the P-load in the Danube River main channel. The adsorption/desorption mechanisms worked as a buffering system by taking up the SRP imported during floods and releasing it over a longer period after the floods. This stimulated high primary production in the floodplain water bodies and impacted the overall P-retention of the floodplain.","Preiner, Stefan;Bondar-Kunze, Elisabeth;Pitzl, Beate;Weigelhofer, Gabriele;Hein, Thomas","Scholarly Journals",2020,NA,"2435334395","proquest",22,"MB","LY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"5","groundwater‐river water exchange enhances growing season evapotranspiration and carbon uptake in a semiarid riparian ecosystem","Semiarid ecosystems play a critical role in determining the interannual variability of the global terrestrial carbon sink. Water availability is a critical driver of productivity in semiarid ecosystems, which often alternate between carbon sink/source functioning during wet/dry years. In this study, we investigate how groundwater availability resulting from groundwater‐river water exchange influences net ecosystem exchange of CO 2 (NEE), evapotranspiration (ET), and the surface energy balance at two semiarid ecosystems along the Columbia River in central Washington, USA. We examined 1&#xa0;year of eddy covariance measurements from an upland sagebrush ecosystem primarily fed by rainfall without groundwater access and a riparian grassland ecosystem with groundwater access during the dry season due to lateral groundwater‐river water exchange. The two sites had distinct seasonal patterns of NEE and ET, driven by differences in water availability. While NEE at the upland sagebrush site was strongly constrained by water availability during the dry months, access to groundwater allowed the riparian site to maintain high NEE magnitude and ET during the same dry months. The riparian site had larger annual gross primary productivity than the upland site (612 vs. 424&#xa0;gC/m 2 ), which was offset by higher ecosystem respiration (558 vs. 363&#xa0;gC/m 2 ). Thus, the magnitude of the annual NEE at the upland site was larger than that at the riparian site (−62 vs. −54&#xa0;gC/m 2 ). Our results demonstrate that groundwater access determined by connectivity between groundwater and surface water can be a critical driver of carbon uptake and ET in semiarid ecosystems.","Missik, Justine E C;Liu, Heping;Gao, Zhongming;Huang, Maoyi;Chen, Xingyuan;Arntzen, Evan;Mcfarland, Douglas P;Ren, Huiying;Titzler, P Scott;Thomle, Jonathan N;Goldman, Amy","Scholarly Journals",2019,124,"2181797202","proquest",29,"MB","PG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"6","hydrological control of system characteristics of floodplain lakes","Water bodies within floodplains are strongly governed by their hydrological connectivity with the main river (Heiler et al. 1995). Connectivity is decisive for the general ecosystem characteristics and the balance between input and output of nutrients and organic carbon sources. A major determinant is the abundance of macrophytic vegetation, which is controlled by through-flow, dry-falling and scouring effects. The autochthonous primary production is strongly augmented by local terrestrial carbon sources and by the riverine transport in form of dissolved and particulate organic matter. The significance of these different sources depends on hydrology. Flood pulses represent a disturbance to pelagic communities (followed by successions) and a source of nutrients. High loads of inorganic nutrients produce conditions for prolific algal growth. High availability of allochthonous organic carbon provides the basis for a prolific bacterial secondary production. Our data emphasize that the stimulus of local aquatic primary production enhances carbon utilization by bacteria.","Schiemer, F;Hein, T;Peduzzi, P","Scholarly Journals",2006,6,"20726653","proquest",36,"MB","LY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"7","landscape ecology: a framework for integrating pattern and process in river corridors","Investigations of European floodplain rivers demonstrate how landscape ecology can provide an effective framework to integrate pattern and process in river corridors, to examine environmental dynamics and interactive pathways between landscape elements, and to develop viable strategies for river conservation. The highly complex and dynamic nature of intact river corridors is particularly amenable to a landscape ecology perspective. Analysis of spatial patterns has provided considerable insight into environmental heterogeneity across river corridors and is an essential prelude to examining dynamic interactions. For example, data from aerial photographs, digitized maps and year-round field measurements in a glacial flood plain, enabled us to distinguish six channel types, based on the correspondence between connectivity and physicochemical attributes. Spatial data were also used to analyze longitudinal changes in landscape elements along the course of a morphologically-intact riverine corridor, providing insight into the structural complexity that must have characterized many Alpine rivers in the pristine state. Landscape indices were employed to investigate seasonal dynamics in a glacial flood plain of the Swiss Alps which exhibits a predictable expansion/contraction cycle, with corresponding shifts in flow paths (surface and subsurface) and water sources (snowmelt, englacial, subglacial, alluvial aquifer, hillslope aquifer). Surface connectivity exhibited an unexpected biphasic relationship with total channel length, whereas riverscape diversity progressively increased along the entire range of channel length. Reconstituting the functional integrity that characterizes intact river corridors should perhaps be the major goal of river conservation initiatives. Although understanding functional processes at the landscape scale is essential in this regard, few data are available. In the Alluvial Zone National Park on the Austrian Danube, three phases of hydrological connectivity were identified (disconnection, seepage connection and surface connection) that corresponded to the predominance of three functional processes (biotic interactions, primary production and particulate transport) within the river corridor.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","Ward, J V;Malard, Florian;Tockner, Klement","Scholarly Journals",2002,17,"739166758","proquest",43,"MB","CP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"8","machine learning algorithm-based risk assessment of riparian wetlands in padma river basin of northwest bangladesh","Wetland risk assessment is a global concern especially in developing countries like Bangladesh. The present study explored the spatiotemporal dynamics of wetlands, prediction of wetland risk assessment. The wetland risk assessment was predicted based on ten selected parameters, such as fragmentation probability, distance to road, and settlement. We used M5P, random forest (RF), reduced error pruning tree (REPTree), and support vector machine (SVM) machine learning techniques for wetland risk assessment. The results showed that wetland areas at present are declining less than one-third of those in 1988 due to the construction of the dam at Farakka, which is situated at the upstream of the Padma River. The distance to the river and built-up area are the two most contributing drivers influencing the wetland risk assessment based on information gain ratio (InGR). The prediction results of machine learning models showed 64.48% of area by M5P, 61.75% of area by RF, 62.18% of area by REPTree, and 55.74% of area by SVM have been predicted as the high and very high-risk zones. The results of accuracy assessment showed that the RF outperformed than other models (area under curve: 0.83), followed by the SVM, M5P, and REPTree. Degradation of wetlands explored in this study demonstrated the negative effects on biodiversity. Therefore, to conserve and protect the wetlands, continuous monitoring of wetlands using high resolution satellite images, feeding with the ecological flow, confining built up area and agricultural expansion towards wetlands, and new wetland creation is essential for wetland management.","Islam, Abu Reza Md Towfiqul;Talukdar, Swapan;Mahato, Susanta;Ziaul, Sk;Eibek, Kutub Uddin;Akhter, Shumona;Pham, Quoc Bao;Mohammadi, Babak;Karimi, Firoozeh;Linh, Nguyen Thi Thuy","Scholarly Journals",2021,28,"2495403946","proquest",50,"MB","ES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"9","reach-scale river metabolism across contrasting sub-catchment geologies; effect of light and hydrology","We investigated the seasonal dynamics of in-stream metabolism at the reach scale ( approximately 150 m) of headwaters across contrasting geological sub-catchments: clay, Greensand, and Chalk of the upper River Avon (UK). Benthic metabolic activity was quantified by aquatic eddy co-variance while water column activity was assessed by bottle incubations. Seasonal dynamics across reaches were specific for the three types of geologies. During the spring, all reaches were net autotrophic, with rates of up to 290 mmol C m (super -2) d (super -1) in the clay reach. During the remaining seasons, the clay and Greensand reaches were net heterotrophic, with peak oxygen consumption of 206 mmol m (super -2) d (super -1) during the autumn, while the Chalk reach was net heterotrophic only in winter. Overall, the water column alone still contributed to approximately 25% of the annual respiration and primary production in all reaches. Net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) across seasons and reaches followed a general linear relationship with increasing stream light availability. Sub-catchment specific NEM proved to be linearly related to the local hydrological connectivity, quantified as the ratio between base flow and stream discharge, and expressed on a timescale of 9 d on average. This timescale apparently represents the average period of hydrological imprint for carbon turnover within the reaches. Combining a general light response and sub-catchment specific base flow ratio provided a robust functional relationship for predicting NEM at the reach scale. The novel approach proposed in this study can help facilitate spatial and temporal upscaling of riverine metabolism that may be applicable to a broader spectrum of catchments.

"10","temperature and precipitation drive temporal variability in aquatic carbon and ghg concentrations and fluxes in a peatland catchment","The aquatic pathway is increasingly being recognized as an important component of catchment carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets, particularly in peatland systems due to their large carbon store and strong hydrological connectivity. In this study, we present a complete 5-year data set of all aquatic carbon and GHG species from an ombrotrophic Scottish peatland. Measured species include particulate and dissolved forms of organic carbon (POC, DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2, CH4 and N2O. We show that short-term variability in concentrations exists across all species and this is strongly linked to discharge. Seasonal cyclicity was only evident in DOC,CO2 and CH4 concentration; however, temperature correlated with monthly means in all species except DIC. Although the temperature correlation with monthly DOC and POC concentrations appeared to be related to biological productivity in the terrestrial system, we suggest the temperature correlation with CO2 and CH4 was primarily due to in-stream temperature-dependent solubility. Interannual variability in total aquatic carbon concentration was strongly correlated with catchment gross primary productivity (GPP) indicating a strong potential terrestrial aquatic linkage. DOC represented the largest aquatic carbon flux term (19.3 plus or minus 4.59 g C m-2 yr-1), followed by CO2 evasion (10.0 g C m-2 yr-1). Despite an estimated contribution to the total aquatic carbon flux of between 8 and 48%, evasion estimates had the greatest uncertainty. Interannual variability in total aquatic carbon export was low in comparison with variability in terrestrial biosphere-atmosphere exchange, and could be explained primarily by temperature and precipitation. Our results therefore suggest that climatic change is likely to have a significant impact on annual carbon losses through the aquatic pathway, and as such, aquatic exports are fundamental to the understanding of whole catchment responses to climate change.","Dinsmore, K J;Billett, M F;Dyson, KE","Scholarly Journals",2013,19,"1372057943","proquest",64,"MB","PG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"11","tracking the resource pulse: movement responses of fish to dynamic floodplain habitat in a tropical river","Natural river floodplains are among the Earth's most biologically diverse and productive ecosystems but face a range of critical threats due to human disturbance. Understanding the ecological processes that support biodiversity and productivity in floodplain rivers is essential for their future protection and rehabilitation. Fish assemblage structure on tropical river floodplains is widely considered to be driven by dispersal limitation during the wet season and by environmental filtering and interspecific interactions during the dry season. However, the individual-level movement behaviours (e.g. site attachment, nomadism, homing) that regulate dispersal of fish on floodplains are poorly understood. We combined radiotelemetry and remote sensing to examine the movement behaviour of two large-bodied fishes (barramundi Lates calcarifer, forktail catfish Neoarius leptaspis) over the flood cycle in a tropical river-floodplain system in northern Australia to: (a) quantify movement responses in relation to dynamic habitat resources at a landscape scale; and (b) determine the extent of spatial 'reshuffling' of individual fish following the wet season. Both species altered their behaviour rapidly in response to changes in the availability and distribution of aquatic habitat, with most individuals undertaking extensive movements (up to similar to 27 km from the tagging location) on the inundated floodplain during the wet season. Although there was considerable individual variation in movement patterns, overall barramundi distributions closely tracked the extent of floodplain primary productivity, whereas catfish distributions were most closely associated with the extent of flooded area. Most individuals of both species exhibited homing back to previously occupied dry season refugia during the wet-to-dry transition, even though other potential refugia were available in closer proximity to wet season activity areas. We postulate that homing behaviour modulates temporal variation in fish assemblage composition and abundance and limits the transfer of aquatic-derived energy and nutrients into terrestrial food webs by reducing fish mortality on drying floodplains. Our study demonstrates the importance of quantifying individual-level behaviour across the three stages of dispersal (emigration, inter-patch movement, immigration) for our understanding of how animal movement influences energetic subsidies and other large-scale ecosystem processes.","Crook, David A.; Buckle, Duncan J.; Morrongiello, John R.; Allsop, Quentin A.; Baldwin, Wayne; Saunders, Thor M.; Douglas, Michael M.","Scholarly Journals",2020,89,"BIOSIS:PREV202000306187","wos",71,"MB","ES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"65","soil bacterial diversity mediated by microscale aqueous-phase processes across biomes","Soil bacterial diversity varies across biomes with potential impacts on soil ecological functioning. Here, we incorporate key factors that affect soil bacterial abundance and diversity across spatial scales into a mechanistic modeling framework considering soil type, carbon inputs and climate towards predicting soil bacterial diversity. The soil aqueous-phase content and connectivity exert strong influence on bacterial diversity for each soil type and rainfall pattern. Biome-specific carbon inputs deduced from net primary productivity provide constraints on soil bacterial abundance independent from diversity. The proposed heuristic model captures observed global trends of bacterial diversity in good agreement with predictions by an individual-based mechanistic model. Bacterial diversity is highest at intermediate water contents where the aqueous phase forms numerous disconnected habitats and soil carrying capacity determines level of occupancy. The framework delineates global soil bacterial diversity hotspots; located mainly in climatic transition zones that are sensitive to potential climate and land use changes. Numerous micro- and macro-scale factors influence soil microbial diversity. Here the authors create a model to demonstrate that fine scale soil moisture influences the carrying capacity of microbes, which then scales up to larger biogeographic patterns.","Bickel, Samuel;Or Dani","Scholarly Journals",2020,11,"2342970499","proquest",61,"PG","MB",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"31","a vital link: water and vegetation in the anthropocene","This paper argues that the interplay of water, carbon and vegetation dynamics fundamentally links some global trends in the current and conceivable future Anthropocene, such as cropland expansion, freshwater use, and climate change and its impacts. Based on a review of recent literature including geographically explicit simulation studies with the process-based LPJmL global biosphere model, it demonstrates that the connectivity of water and vegetation dynamics is vital for water security, food security and (terrestrial) ecosystem dynamics alike. The water limitation of net primary production of both natural and agricultural plants - already pronounced in many regions - is shown to increase in many places under projected climate change, though this development is partially offset by water-saving direct CO sub(2) effects. Natural vegetation can to some degree adapt dynamically to higher water limitation, but agricultural crops usually require some form of active management to overcome it - among them irrigation, soil conservation and eventually shifts of cropland to areas that are less water-limited due to more favourable climatic conditions. While crucial to secure food production for a growing world population, such human interventions in water-vegetation systems have, as also shown, repercussions on the water cycle. Indeed, land use changes are shown to be the second-most important influence on the terrestrial water balance in recent times. Furthermore, climate change (warming and precipitation changes) will in many regions increase irrigation demand and decrease water availability, impeding rainfed and irrigated food production (if not CO sub(2) effects counterbalance this impact - which is unlikely at least in poorly managed systems). Drawing from these exemplary investigations, some research perspectives on how to further improve our knowledge of human-water-vegetation interactions in the Anthropocene are outlined.","Gerten, D","Scholarly Journals",2013,17,"1464514962","proquest",3,"LY","MB",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"55","opening the tap: increased riverine connectivity strengthens marine food web pathways","Reduction of ecosystem connectivity has long-lasting impacts on food webs. Anadromous fish, which migrate from marine to freshwater ecosystems to complete reproduction, have seen their historically larger ecosystem role undercut by widespread riverine habitat fragmentation and other impacts mainly derived from anthropogenic sources. The result has been extensive extirpations and increased susceptibility to a suite of environmental factors that currently impede recovery. Under this present-day context of reduced productivity and connectivity, aggressive management actions and enforcement of catch limits including bycatch caps and complete moratoria on harvest have followed. What remains less understood are the implications of changes to food webs that co-occurred. What benefits restoration could provide in terms of ecosystem functioning in relation to economic costs associated with dam removal and remediation is unknown and can limit the scope and value of restoration activities. Here we employ, historical landscape-based biomass estimates of anadromous alosine for the first time in an ecosystem modeling of the Northeast US large marine ecosystem ( LME), to evaluate the value of improving connectivity by measuring the increase in energy flow and population productivity. We compared a restored alosine model to a contemporary model, analyzing the impacts of the potential increase of connectivity between riverine and oceanic systems. There was the potential for a moderate biomass increase of piscivorous species with high economic value, including Atlantic cod, and for a major increase for species of conservation concern such as pelagic sharks, seabirds and marine mammals. Our study highlights the benefits of increased connectivity between freshwater and ocean ecosystems. We demonstrate the significant role anadromous forage fish could play in improving specific fisheries and overall ecosystem functioning, mainly through the diversification of species capable of transferring primary production to upper trophic levels, adding to benefits associated with their restoration.","Dias, Beatriz S.; Frisk, Michael G.; Jordaan, Adrian","Scholarly Journals",2019,14,"BIOSIS:PREV201900594533","wos",53,"DC","MB",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
