"3","abiotic variability among different aquatic systems of the central amazon floodplain during drought and flood events","This paper examines water properties from lakes, channels and paleo-channels located in Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve, in Central Amazon floodplain, Amazonas, Brazil. The authors analysed surface temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, transparency, suspended inorganic and organic matter, chlorophyll-a, pheophytin, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, organic and inorganic carbon in 2009 high water phase, 2009 and 2010 low water phases. Multivariate statistical analyses of 24 aquatic systems (6 ressacas, 12 lakes and 6 channels, 142 samples) were applied to the variables. First, they analysed the entire set of variables to test for differences among phases of the hydrological year and types of aquatic systems using a PERMANOVA two-way crossed design. The results showed that the all measured limnological variables are distinct regarding both factors: types of aquatic systems and hydrological phases. In general, the magnitude and amplitude of all variables were higher in the low water phase than in the high water phase, except for water transparency in all aquatic system's types.","Affonso, A G;Queiroz, H L","Scholarly Journals","2015","75","1757013661","proquest","ES","LY","N","central Amazon floodplain","Y","surface temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, transparency, suspended inorganic and organic matter, chlorophyll-a, pheophytin, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, organic and inorganic carbon","hydrologic phase (stage?)","Y",NA,"chl_3"
"4","abundance and biomass responses of microbial food web components to hydrology and environmental gradients within a floodplain of the river danube","This study investigated the relationships of time-dependent hydrological variability and selected microbial food web components. Samples were collected monthly from the KopaÄki Rit floodplain in Croatia, over a period of 19Â months, for analysis of bacterioplankton abundance, cell size and biomass; abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and nanophytoplankton; and concentration of chlorophyll a. Similar hydrological variability at different times of the year enabled partition of seasonal effects from hydrological changes on microbial community properties. The results suggested that, unlike some other studies investigating sites with different connectivity, bacterioplankton abundance, and phytoplankton abundance and biomass increased during lentic conditions. At increasing water level, nanophytoplankton showed lower sensitivity to disturbance in comparison with total phytoplankton biomass: this could prolong autotrophic conditions within the floodplain. Bacterioplankton biomass, unlike phytoplankton, was not impacted by hydrology. The bacterial biomass less affected by hydrological changes can be an important additional food component for the floodplain food web. The results also suggested a mechanism controlling bacterial cell size independent of hydrology, as bacterial cell size was significantly decreased as nanoflagellate abundance increased. Hydrology, regardless of seasonal sucession, has the potential to structure microbial food webs, supporting microbial development during lentic conditions. Conversely, other components appear unaffected by hydrology or may be more strongly controlled by biotic interactions. This research, therefore, adds to understanding on microbial food web interactions in the context of flood and flow pulses in river-floodplain ecosystems.","Palijan, Goran","Scholarly Journals","2012","64","1400127912","proquest","MB","PG","n","floodplain","y","bacterioplankton abundance, size, and biomass; abundance of nanoflaggellates and nanophytoplankton; concentration of cholorphyll a","unclear; water level","y","The information in the abstract does not seem directly relevant (no clear connectivity metric, focus on microbial community), but mentions measuring chlorophyll a, so maybe worth looking at full text","chl_4"

"6","an abiotic typology and reference conditions for nutrients and chlorophyll-a in subtropical reservoirs (são paulo state, brazil)","The establishment of reference conditions and typology are two important steps in water resources management. The reference conditions enable the determination of how impacted an ecosystem is, while the typology facilitates the implementation of management procedures. A study of subtropical reservoirs in São Paulo State (Brazil) was performed to obtain (1) an abiotic typology, using principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (Ward's method with Euclidean distances), and (2) reference conditions for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the dry and rainy seasons for one of the established typologies. Two main statistical techniques were used: the lake population distribution approach and the trisection method. PCA identified an environmental gradient in the east-west direction, with reservoirs at higher latitudes and with larger dimensions in the west, and smaller reservoirs in eastern areas with higher altitude and higher average annual rainfall. The PCA and cluster analysis indicated that there were four main types of reservoirs. The nutrient criteria techniques, obtained for 13 type I rainy-east reservoirs, were not significantly different (t test, p &lt; 0.05). Although the methods resulted in similar reference conditions, one-way ANOVA indicated significant differences between the seasons for Chl-a, which levels were slightly higher in the rainy season. As far as we know, this is the first study to simultaneously provide an abiotic typology and reference conditions for chlorophyll-a and nutrients in different seasons, considering subtropical reservoirs in South America. This investigation makes an important contribution to the monitoring and management of subtropical reservoirs, and the promotion of dialog between the scientific community and managers, aiming at ensuring the sustainability of water bodies.","Cardoso-Silva, Sheila;Frascareli, Daniele;Silva, Daniel C V R;Figueira, Rubens César Lopes;Bittencourt, Marisa Dantas;Moschini-Carlos, Viviane;Pompêo, Marcelo","Scholarly Journals","2021","28","2465440501","proquest","ES","RP","N","reservoir","Y","Chl-a, Total N, Total P","abiotic typology, reference conditions ","N",NA,"chl_5"
"7","aquatic metabolism short-term response to the flood pulse in a mediterranean floodplain","The pulsing of river discharge affects biodiversity and productivity of whole river-floodplain ecosystems, triggering the transport, storage and processing of carbon. In this study we investigate the short-term changes in water chemistry and net pelagic metabolism (NEP) in two floodplain lakes in response to a flood pulse. The two oxbow lakes investigated in the floodplain of the Mediterranean Ebro River (NE Spain) showed a clear temporal shift in their metabolic balance, controlled by the river discharge and associated changes in water physical and chemical characteristics. Water chemistry (turbidity, water organic matter, chlorophyll a and nutrients concentration) returned to pre-flood values after 4 days, highlighting the resilience of the ecosystem to flood pulses. Lake NEP was depressed before and during floods to a minimum of -34 mg O-2 m(-3) h(-1), and increased after the flood pulse to a maximum of +463 mg O-2 m(-3) h(-1). The phytoplankton assemblage showed before and after floods a replacement of autotrophic species (e.g. Chlorophyceans) by mixotrophic organisms (e.g. Cryptophyceans, Euglenoids). A linear mixed effects model identified abiotic factors, particularly temperature and river discharge, as significant predictors of the net aquatic metabolism and community respiration during flood conditions. Our results suggest that the role of the Ebro floodplain lakes as sources or sinks of C is complex and relative to the time scale investigated, depending strongly on the river discharge dynamics and the transport of limiting nutrients (phosphorus).","Gallardo, B.; Espanol, C.; Comin, F.

"10","assessing the effects of lateral hydrological connectivity alteration on freshwater ecosystems: a meta-analysis","The alteration of lateral hydrological connectivity (LHC) is among the major causes of decline in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services in river-floodplain ecosystems. Yet, the effects of LHC alteration on aquatic ecosystems have not been rigorously tested and synthesized. Here, we conducted a literature review and meta-analysis to provide a global synthesis of the effects of LHC alteration on aquatic ecosystems, and to test the effectiveness of indicators for bioassessment. In our review we found that the effects of LHC alteration were disproportionally documented in terms of geographic distribution and research subject. Most studies were conducted in Europe and America on the biodiversity and abundance of macroinvertebrates and fish. In our meta-analysis, we compared effect sizes between pairs of three LHC levels, i.e. disconnected, moderately connected, and highly connected. We found that only a limited number of water quality indicators (e.g. chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen) and biological community indicators (e.g. fish species richness, and zooplankton abundance) showed significant differences between LHC levels. The responses of these indicators to LHC alteration differed, and sometimes in opposing directions. We found out responsive indicators and their response trends, which could not only facilitate effective biomonitoring and bioassessment with regard to engineering and restoration of LHC, but also provide scientific underpinnings of the understanding of trade-offs among the indicators. We identified knowledge gaps and provided recommendations on how to fill these gaps, which included investigating rarely documented regions, developing new indicators, and quantifying mechanistic links between LHC and ecosystem functioning and services.","Shen, Minghua;Liu, Xueqin","Scholarly Journals","2021","125","2524279576","proquest","check","ES","?","multiple","N","WQ+biological community indicators","effect sizes of connectivity","Y",NA,"chl_7"
"11","assessing the potential health risk of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in lake naivasha, kenya","This study discerned the causes of cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Naivasha (Kenya). We hypothesized that phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass respond to hydrologic cycles, peaking during the wet season, and that microcystin (MC) concentrations are highest following the bloom collapse. Hydrologic loading (inferred from rainfall and lake level changes) and phytoplankton responses in two basins of the lake were monitored over a wet season followed by a dry season between September 2010 and March 2011. Results show that both phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass peaked in both basins during the wet season, with associated peaks in particulate MC concentrations. Even though phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass were higher in the smaller deep basin, MC concentrations were lower than in the large shallow basin. The high-MC levels during the wet season were followed by a greater MC production per cyanobacteria biomass unit in the dry season in both basins. The timing of the cyanobacteria bloom suggests that its formation was likely controlled by large nutrient influxes from the contributing catchment to the lake associated with intense rainfall following an intense drought, posing a risk to the health of the community due to increased MC levels.","Raffoul, M.

They were both covered by macrophytes and they had different hydrological connectivity to the Danube. The six sampling campaigns from April to October 2014 included parallel samples from the Danube River at Mohacs, Hungary. Bacterial abundance was the highest in spring and in Mocskos-Danube, followed by Mohacs and Riha.

"13","benthic algal response to hyporheic-surface water exchange in an alluvial river","We studied the response of benthic algae to points of hyporheic-surface water exchange in the main channel of the Middle Fork Flathead River within the Nyack Flood Plain, Montana. We examined hyporheic exchange at 120 sites using piezometers and measuring vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG), hydraulic conductivity, and vertical discharge. We removed benthic algae from a single cobble at each site, and we used VHG to group sampling sites for statistical analysis. Algal cell density and chlorophyll a concentration were significantly higher at sites with hyporheic discharge (+VHG, upwelling) compared to both sites with hyporheic recharge (-VHG, downwelling) and sites with no hyporheic-surface water exchange (=VHG, neutral) (ANOVA, P < 0.05). The assemblages of algae at upwelling sites were also significantly different from downwelling and neutral exchange sites (ANOSIM, P < 0.05). Filamentous green algae Stigeoclonium sp. and Zygnema sp. and a chrysophyte, Hydrurus foetidus (Villars) Trevisan were abundant at upwelling sites, whereas an assemblage of diatoms Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kutzing) Czarnecki, Cymbella excisa Kutzing, Diatoma moniliformis Kutzing, and Gomphonema olivaceoides Hustedt, were the most abundant taxa at downwelling and neutral exchange sites, occurring attached to, or in close association with the stalks of Didymosphenia geminata (Lyngbye) Schmidt. These data show that benthic algal communities are structured differently depending on the direction of hyporheic flux in the main channel of a large alluvial river, suggesting that hyporheic-surface exchange may influence the spatial distribution of main-channel benthic algae in rivers with hyporheic-surface water connectivity.","Wyatt, Kevin H.; Hauer, F.

We evaluated carryover effects of hydroperiod length (50-62 days) on amphibian survival, developmental rates, and locomotor performance using a model organism, the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), through aquatic and terrestrial mesocosm experiments with individual tests of locomotor performance. We found that shorter hydroperiods (50 days) had low larval survival (0.44 ± 0.03) compared to the 62-day hydroperiod (0.91 ± 0.09) and increased developmental rates, resulting in smaller sizes at metamorphosis. We did not find evidence of carryover effects on terrestrial survival three months post-metamorphosis with all hydroperiod treatments showing high terrestrial survival (0.88 ± 0.07). However, post-metamorphic frogs from the longer hydroperiod treatments grew faster and larger compared to individuals from shortest hydroperiods and performed significantly better during endurance trials at 18 °C. Disentangling complex carryover effects across multiple life stages in species with high phenotypic plasticity can shed light on the physiological capacity of species to respond to changing environments and inform mechanistic predictions of persistence in the face of anthropogenic stressors.","Thompson, Cassandra M;Popescu, Viorel D","Scholarly Journals","2021","195","2494302612","proquest","PG","LY","n ","temporary ponds","y","amphibian survival, developmental rates, and locomotor performance (results in larval survival, developmental rates, sizes at metamorphosis, terrestrial survival, size and growth, three months post-metamorphosis)","hydroperiods length (days)","y","model organism, the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), through aquatic and terrestrial mesocosm experiments","chl_14"

"19","connectivity and habitat typology drive co2 and ch4 fluxes across land-water interfaces in lowland rivers","Lowland rivers are assumed to be a net source of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). However, little is known about the contribution of marginal permanent and temporary riverine aquatic systems to river carbon metabolism. Elevation, in relation to flooding, hydro-morphological, and ecological features of such habitats, can affect the gas fluxes across the water-atmosphere interfaces and the periodically air-exposed riverbeds. This hypothesis was investigated in the lowland sector of the Po River (Northern Italy) from May to September 2008. Five different aquatic habitats were considered: the main river course; a backwater habitat; and three lateral lentic waterbodies-an oxbow and two quarry lakes of different age. The water mass was always CO2 and CH4 supersaturated, and gas fluxes were from the water to the atmosphere. In the highly dynamic river course and backwaters, CO2 emission rates were nearly one order of magnitude greater than in the lentic and hypoxic oxbow and quarry lakes. By contrast, CH4 fluxes peaked in the lentic, deeper, and permanent water bodies. At sediment-atmosphere interfaces, the CO2 emissions increased along an organic matter, a water saturation, and a chlorophyll a gradient, attaining the maximum rates in the periodically air-exposed riverbed and marginal sandy sediments. These differences in gas fluxes resulted from either the submersion persistence or the alternation of submersion and emersion phases, which were ultimately due to the gap between elevation and river water variations. All this stresses the critical role of marginal aquatic habitats for river C budget.","Bolpagni, Rossano; Laini, Alex; Mutti, Tiziana; Viaroli, Pierluigi; Bartoli, Marco","Scholarly Journals","2019","12","BIOSIS:PREV201900212838","wos","PG","ES","n","main river,  backwater habitat; and three lateral lentic waterbodies-an oxbow and two quarry lakes of different age","y","sediment-atmosphere interfaces, CO2 emissions, organic matter, a water saturation, CO2, CH4and chlorophyll a","location","y",NA,"chl_16"

"21","contrasts between channels and backwaters in a large, floodplain river: testing our understanding of nutrient cycling, phytoplankton abundance, and suspended solids dynamics","In floodplain rivers, variability in hydraulic connectivity interacts with biogeochemistry to determine the distribution of suspended and dissolved substances. Nutrient, chlorophyll a, and suspended solids data spanning longitudinal (5 study reaches across 1300 river km), lateral (main channel and backwaters), and temporal (1994-2011) gradients in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) were used to examine the extent to which observed differences between the main channel and backwaters were consistent with expectations based on current understanding of biogeochemical processes in large rivers. For N and P, the results largely conformed to expectations. N concentrations were greater in the main channel than in the backwaters in 82 to 96% of the observations across river reaches. Maximum TP concentrations generally occurred in backwaters during summer, when backwater TP often exceeded that of the main channel. Flux of P from sediments may be a substantial source of water-column P in UMR backwaters in summer. The data for suspended solids and chlorophyll a suggest that some refinements are needed of our understanding of ecosystem processes in large rivers. During low-discharge conditions, concentrations of inorganic suspended solids often were greater in backwaters than in the main channel, suggesting the importance of sediment resuspension. Chlorophyll a concentrations were usually greater in backwaters than in the main channel, but exceptions indicate that phytoplankton abundance in the main channel of the UMR can sometimes be greater than is typically expected for large rivers.","Houser, Jeffrey N.","Scholarly Journals","2016","35","BIOSIS:PREV201600572060","wos","PG","ES","n","river-floodplain","y","Nutrient, chlorophyll a, and suspended solids","main channel and backwaters","y",NA,"chl_17"

Here we test the hypothesis that differences in environmental variables act as environmental filters on the composition and trophic structure of local the fish fauna of a subtropical mountain river. We predict that differences in the trophic structure of the fish fauna occur along the river continuum. Main environmental parameters have been measured and fishes were sampled quarterly between August 2013 and May 2014 at six sampling sites in the main channel of the Pelotas River, Upper Uruguay ecoregion. We collected 3848 individuals belonging to 38 species, 4 orders and 11 families. The most (82.1%) consisted of small- and medium-sized individuals. The species were classified into eight trophic guilds: aquatic insectivorous, carnivorous, detritivorous, detritivorous/aquatic insectivorous, herbivorous, iliophagous, omnivorous and piscivorous. In general, herbivorous and piscivorous guilds were the most representative in both number and biomass. Significant differences detected by Permanova were for richness, numerical abundance and biomass between all the sites sampled. Relationships between the environmental variables and the composition of trophic guilds were observed along the longitudinal gradient by RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. The abundance of guilds omnivorous, aquatic insectivorous and herbivorous increases with higher values of chlorophyll- a and vegetation cover, especially characterizing the upstream sites (S1, S2 and S3). On the other hand, the abundance of the iliophagous, detritivorous/insectivorous and piscivorous guilds increases with greater values of width, temperature, inorganic phosphorus and total solids, a fact observed in downstream sites (S4, S5 and S6). Thus, it was possible to identify a clear variation in the trophic structure of the fish fauna along the Pelotas River (upstream-downstream), in which the local variables were efficient in predicting environmental filters that influence the trophic organization. In this scenario, our study follows the longitudinal model and evidences a greater accumulation of energy in food webs in the upstream-downstream direction, which favors the greatest abundance of piscivorous, detritivorous and iliophagous verified in stretches of greater volume and dimensions of river.

"27","factors influencing algal biomass in intermittently connected, subtropical coastal ponds","Microalgae may contribute more to salt marsh productivity than realized, underscoring the importance of understanding algal dynamics in such systems. Benthic and planktonic chlorophyll-a (surrogate for total algal biomass), sediment ash-free dry weight, total suspended solids, salinity, and nutrients were examined in intermittently connected marsh ponds in the subtropical Guadalupe Estuary, Texas, USA to determine the effects of hydrologic connections on algal biomass in this system. From May 2005 to May 2006, several high water events resulting in surface water connections between ponds and nearby tidal creeks occurred, followed by disconnection and, at times, pond desiccation. During periods of disconnection, algal biomass was higher in both the benthos and the water column than during connection events when flushing occurred. Since connection events did not increase NOx, the primary source of dissolved inorganic nitrogen seemed to be nutrient cycling within the ponds. Data at the aggregated level, i.e., chlorophyll-a, indicated this system followed the flood pulse concept. During high water events, algal biomass may be exported to supplement the tidal creek food web (aquatic), whereas during low water events accumulated biomass within the ponds feed the marsh food web (terrestrial), which includes blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and the whooping crane (Grus americana).","Miller, Carrie J;Davis, Stephen E;Roelke, Daniel L;Li, Hsiu-Ping;Driffill, Matthew J","Scholarly Journals","2009","29","21126083","proquest","RP","CP","N","lake","Y","chla","not provided","Y","salt marsh ponds","chl_22"
"28","fish assemblages of tropical floodplain lagoons: exploring the role of connectivity in a dry year","Irregular rainfall and pronounced reductions of the hydrometric level in the year 2000 resulted in drastically altered hydrological connectivity of lentic environments in the upper Parana River floodplain. The objective of the present work was to examine spatial and temporal patterns of fish assemblage attributes and structure in relation to limnological variables associated with hydrological connectivity. Fish were collected quarterly by seining in the marginal areas of 15 lagoons belonging to two biotopic categories (connected and disconnected). Variation, in assemblage composition reflected the degree of hydrological connectivity. Values of assemblage attributes (species richness, density and biomass) were significantly lower in connected lagoons than in disconnected lagoons. Significantly higher values of species richness and biomass were recorded in November than in August. Rare species had the greatest effect on observed patterns in fish assemblage ordination (DCA). Observed patterns of variation in assemblage attributes were directly correlated with factors related to hydrological connectivity, such as depth, resources (zooplankton and chlorophyll a) and nutrients (total phosphorus).","Petry, Ana Cristina; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio; Gomes, Luiz Carlos","Scholarly Journals","2003","1","BIOSIS:PREV200510180551","wos","DC","LY","n","river floodplain","y","fish community composition and biomass","depth","y","chla is included in predictors, but is not the main response variable, so may not work","chl_23"

Thirty lakes in portions of Mississippi and Arkansas were surveyed for chlorophyll-a fluorescence and turbidity using handheld meters to determine relationships between chlorophyll-a concentrations and suspended solids. High applicability of handheld meters in the MAV presents economic benefits for monitoring the numerous lakes in the region. Additionally, twelve lakes within Bear Creek watershed, Mississippi were studied to determine how hydrologic connectivity shapes fish communities. Isolated and permanently connected floodplain lakes exhibited characteristically lacustrine and rheophilic fish communities, respectively, diversifying fishery management opportunities. Lastly, spring diel temperature and oxygen dynamics, as well as juvenile fish communities, were assessed within three habitats in a floodplain lake - pelagic environment, margin and contiguous wetlands. Variability in temperature and oxygen across the three habitats promotes spring habitat heterogeneity while supporting distinct but overlapping juvenile fish assemblages.","Steiner Andrews, Caroline Noelle","Books","2013","52","1520375284","proquest","ES","MB","N","floodplain 'lakes'","Y","fish communities","habitat type","Y",NA,"chl_24"
"30","floods increase similarity among aquatic habitats in river-floodplain systems","During low water levels, habitats in river-floodplain systems are isolated from each other and from the main river. Oppositely, floods tend to connect water bodies with distinct hydrological characteristics and, as a result, ecological processes and biological communities tend to be more similar among the distinct habitats that comprise a river-floodplain system. Based on a literature review and also using unpublished data obtained in tropical floodplains, the aim of this paper is to highlight the effects of floods as a process that reduce spatial variability. The usual negative relationship between the coefficient of variation of any ecological indicator (e.g., chlorophyll-a or total phosphorus) and water level is the main result demonstrating a reduction in spatial variability due to floods. Considering physical, chemical or biotic data gathered in distinct habitats within the floodplain, this pattern was found in temperate and tropical regions, subjected to distinct levels of anthropogenic impacts, and at different spatial extents. The main mechanism that accounts for this pattern may be stated as follow. During low water level, the biological communities of each habitat in the floodplain (e.g. lagoons, backwater, streams) follow distinct temporal trajectories due to the effects of local driving forces (e.g. an efficient predator trapped in a lagoon but not in another). Management plans and biodiversity conservation in river floodplain systems will benefit by considering the effects of flood homogenization and increased connectivity peculiar to these unique ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","Thomaz, Sidinei M;Bini, Luis Mauricio;Bozelli, Reinaldo Luiz","Scholarly Journals","2007","579","821237454","proquest","DC","MB","n","river-floodplain systems","n","chlorophyll and nutrients","water level","y","Combination of literature review and analysis of unpublished data","chl_25"

"32","functional indicators of stream health: a river-basin approach","Summary1. The efficacy of leaf-litter decomposition, sediment respiration, biofilm biomass, growth, chlorophyll a concentration and the autotrophic index (biofilm ash-free dry mass-chlorophyll a) and fungal biomass for detecting human-induced change was evaluated using 24 references and 15 disturbed stream sites located in central Portugal.2. Decomposition rates of alder (Alnus glutinosa) and oak (Quercus robur) leaves and sediment respiration rates were effective in discriminating impairment. Decomposition was negatively correlated with abiotic factors, such as ammonium and nitrite concentrations, connectivity and alterations in the hydrological regime, and positively correlated with nitrate concentration and oxygen concentration. Sediment respiration rates were correlated with organic contamination, land use and morphological changes.3. Growth rates of biofilm, concentration of chlorophyll a and the autotrophic index, although 41-73% higher at disturbed compared to reference sites, were not significantly different. These three variables were significantly correlated with total organic carbon, oxygen concentration, pH, nitrite and the presence of dams. Fungal biomass on leaves and biofilm biomass on natural substrata did not differ between reference and disturbed sites.4. Our findings lend support to the use of functional variables like decomposition and sediment respiration in monitoring and when used together with structural variables should give a more holistic measure of stream health.","FEIO, MJ;Alves, T;BOAVIDA, M;Medeiros, A;Graca, Mas","Scholarly Journals","2010","55","746081344","proquest","PG","LY","n","stream","y","leaf-litter decomposition, sediment respiration, biofilm biomass, growth, chlorophyll a concentration and the autotrophic index","dams/alterations in the hydrological regime","y",NA,"chl_27"

"34","granal stacking of thylakoid membranes in higher plant chloroplasts: the physicochemical forces at work and the functional consequences that ensue","The formation of grana in chloroplasts of higher plants is examined in terms of the subtle interplay of physicochemical forces of attraction and repulsion. The attractive forces between two adjacent membranes comprise (1) van der Waals attraction that depends on the abundance and type of atoms in each membrane, on the distance between the membranes and on the dielectric constant, (2) depletion attraction that generates local order by granal stacking at the expense of greater disorder (i.e. entropy) in the stroma, and (3) an electrostatic attraction of opposite charges located on adjacent membranes. The repulsive forces comprise (1) electrostatic repulsion due to the net negative charge on the outer surface of thylakoid membranes, (2) hydration repulsion that operates at small separations between thylakoid membranes due to layers of bound water molecules, and (3) steric hindrance due to bulky protrusions of Photosystem I (PSI) and ATP synthase into the stroma. In addition, specific interactions may occur, but they await experimental demonstration. Although grana are not essential for photosynthesis, they are ubiquitous in higher plants. Grana may have been selected during evolution for the functional advantages that they confer on higher plants. The functional consequences of grana stacking include (1) enhancement of light capture through a vastly increased area-to-volume ratio and connectivity of several PSIIs with large functional antenna size, (2) the ability to control the lateral separation of PSI from PSII and, therefore, the balanced distribution of excitation energy between two photosystems working in series, (3) the reversible fine-tuning of energy distribution between the photosystems by State 1-State 2 transitions, (4) the ability to regulate light-harvesting via controlled thermal dissipation of excess excitation energy, detected as non-photochemical quenching, (5) dynamic flexibility in the light reactions mediated by a granal structure in response to regulation by a trans-thylakoid pH gradient, (6) delaying the premature degradation of D1 and D2 reaction-centre protein(s) in PSII by harbouring photoinactived PSIIs in appressed granal domains, (7) enhancement of the rate of non-cyclic synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as well as the regulation of non-cyclic vs. cyclic ATP synthesis, and (8) the potential increase of photosynthetic capacity for a given composition of chloroplast constituents in full sunlight, concomitantly with enhancement of photochemical efficiency in canopy shade. Hence chloroplast ultrastructure and function are intimately intertwined.","Chow, Wah Soon; Kim, Eun-Ha; Horton, Peter; Anderson, Jan M.","Scholarly Journals","2005","4","BIOSIS:PREV200600205047","wos","MB","PG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"n","Not relevant, about chloroplasts","chl_28"

"36","hydrologic controls on the trophic status of shallow lakes on the boreal plain","The trophic status of shallow lakes on the Boreal Plain of Alberta exhibits high natural variation in space and time. It is not currently known what the dominant controls on this variation are at regional scales and over longer time periods. The aim of this thesis is to characterize the natural variation in trophic status, as measured by the concentration of chlorophyll a (CHLa), and assess the importance of hydrology, captured by climatic and landscape metrics, in explaining the spatial and temporal variation in trophic status. Indicators of trophic status were derived from Landsat images acquired during late summer (August) over a 20 year period from 1984 to 2003. A two-way analysis of variance revealed that of the total variation in CHLa, approximately 50 percent was in the spatial component, 10 percent was in the temporal component and 40 percent was in the spatio-temporal component, which also included the error term. Variation in the temporal component was related non-linearly to climate, as measured by effective precipitation (precipitation minus evapotranspiration). The relation between CHLa and climate indicated that under wet conditions CHLa decreased possibly due to phosphorus dilution and that under dry conditions CHLa increased possibly due to phosphorus concentration. Variation in the spatial component was related to indicators of groundwater and surface water connectivity. Lakes, situated in regional groundwater flow systems, exhibited higher CHLa than lakes situated in local groundwater flow systems. For the majority of lakes, situated in local groundwater flow systems, high wetland cover in their catchments corresponded to low CHLa whereas low wetland cover corresponded to high CHLa. For the minority of lakes, located in regional groundwater flow systems, higher stream connectivity was associated with higher CHLa. Overall, groundwater and surface water variables explained 74 percent of the spatial variation and climatic variables explained 78 percent of the temporal variation. These results underscore the importance of considering hydrology when understanding the sources of variation in trophic status measured at regional scales over long time periods. Incorporating hydrologic knowledge in resource management may help in mitigating impacts of resource activities.","Sass, Gabor Z","Books","2006","68","20435600","proquest","ES","RP","N","lake","Y","trophic status (Chl-a)","climatic and landscape metrics","N",NA,"chl_30"

"38","hydrologic variability, water chemistry, and phytoplankton biomass in a large floodplain of the sacramento river, ca, u.s.a","The Yolo Bypass, a large, managed floodplain that discharges to the headwaters of the San Francisco Estuary, was studied before, during, and after a single, month-long inundation by the Sacramento River in winter and spring 2000. The primary objective was to identify hydrologic conditions and other factors that enhance production of phytoplankton biomass in the floodplain waters. Recent reductions in phytoplankton have limited secondary production in the river and estuary, and increased phytoplankton biomass is a restoration objective for this system. Chlorophyll a was used as a measure of phytoplankton biomass in this study. Chlorophyll a concentrations were low (<4 mug l-1) during inundation by the river when flow through the floodplain was high, but concentrations rapidly increased as river inflow decreased and the floodplain drained. Therefore, hydrologic conditions in the weeks following inundation by river inflow appeared most important for producing phytoplankton biomass in the floodplain. Discharges from local streams were important sources of water to the floodplain before and after inundation by the river, and they supplied dissolved inorganic nutrients while chlorophyll a was increasing. Discharge from the floodplain was enriched in chlorophyll a relative to downstream locations in the river and estuary during the initial draining and later when local stream inflows produced brief discharge pulses. Based on the observation that phytoplankton biomass peaks during drainage events, we suggest that phytoplankton production in the floodplain and biomass transport to downstream locations would be higher in years with multiple inundation and draining sequences.","Schemel, Laurence Edward; Sommer, Ted R.; Muller-Solger, Anke B.; Harrell, William C.","Scholarly Journals","2004","513","BIOSIS:PREV200400273679","wos","DC","RP","n","floodplain and river","y","chlorophyll-a","floodplain inundation","y",NA,"chl_31"

Here, we measured water balance and limnological variables (water chemistry, suspended sediments, chlorophyll-a) at 20 ponds near Churchill (Manitoba) three times during the ice-free season of 2010 to explore relations among hydrological connectivity, basin morphometry, and water chemistry variations. Using principal components analysis, we identified that the ponds followed one of four distinctive ""seasonal water chemistry trajectories"" (SWCT1-4). Most of the ponds that lacked apparent hydrologic connectivity displayed SWCT1, characterized by rising alkalinity and ionic content between early June and late July due to evaporative concentration. In contrast, most ponds with apparent hydrological connectivity displayed SWCT2 or SWCT3, characterized by marked changes in suspended sediment and total nitrogen concentrations due to inflow that transferred allochthonous materials from the catchment. Ponds in SWCT2 likely possessed temporary hydrological connections during periods of relatively high water supply and exhibited marked decline of suspended sediment and total nitrogen content when hydrological connection was lost. Most ponds in SWCT3 maintained active hydrological connections during all or most of the ice-free season and possessed relatively high suspended sediment and total nitrogen concentrations throughout the season.

Connected lakes showed significantly higher concentrations of available nutrients and chlorophyll but the relationship between the two variables was weak in the spring and non-existent in the summer. Suspended solids were also more abundant in connected than in isolated lakes.

Based on water level dynamics and water retention times, three phases of river-floodplain connectivity were identified: disconnection (phase I), seepage inflow (phase II) and upstream surface connection (phase III). The frequency of occurrence of these phases was 67.5%, 29.3% and 3.2%, respectively, during the study period. 3.

"47","hydrological seasonality and benthic algal biomass in a neotropical floodplain river","Our study evaluated spatiotemporal variation of physicochemical parameters and benthic and sestonic algal biomass in littoral areas of the main channel and floodplain lakes of the Cinaruco River, a lowland tributary of the Orinoco River in Venezuela. The Cinaruco is characterized by a highly predictable annual flood pulse, high transparency, and extremely low conductivity and suspended sediment load. During 2002 and 2003, 10 sites in the main channel and floodplain lagoons were sampled on 12 occasions. Correspondence analysis based on water physicochemical variables and algal biomass showed that (similar to)80% of the variation in the multivariate space among sites and sampling dates was explained by 2 axes. During the high-water periods, river and lagoon sites showed high similarity in water variables and algal biomass. Conductivity, SiO 3 , and chlorophyll a concentrations (both benthic and sestonic) were low during the high-water phase. On the other hand, water variables and algal biomass differed between river and lagoon sites during the low-water period. The absence of flow in lagoons and consistently low algal biomass (sestonic and benthic) in river sites were the most important features of the spatial variability between main channel and lagoon sites during low-water phases. Benthic chlorophyll a was highly uniform at small spatial scales and significantly heterogeneous at large spatial scales. The annual flood regime of the Cinaruco, which drives the concentrations of dissolved materials and affects material interchanges between aquatic and terrestrial systems, also appears to be responsible for creating strong patterns of seasonal and spatial variation in benthic algal crops.

"50","immigration and early life stages recruitment of the european flounder (platichthys flesus) to an estuarine nursery: the influence of environmental factors","Connectivity between coastal spawning grounds and estuarine nurseries is a critical step in the life cycle of many fish species. Larval immigration and transport-associated physical–biological processes are determinants of recruitment success to nursery areas. The recruitment of the European flounder, Platichthys flesus, to estuarine nurseries located at the southern edge of the species distribution range, has been usually investigated during its juvenile stages, while estuarine recruitment during the earlier planktonic life stage remains largely unstudied. The present study investigated the patterns of flounder larval recruitment and the influence of environmental factors on the immigration of the early life stages to the Lima estuary (NW Portugal), integrating data on fish larvae and post-settlement individuals (&lt;50mm length), collected over 7years. Late-stage larvae arrived at the estuary between February and July and peak abundances were observed in April. Post-settlement individuals (&lt;50mm) occurred later between April and October, whereas newly-settled ones (&lt;20mm) were found only in May and June. Variables associated with the spawning, survival and growth of larvae in the ocean (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a and inland hydrological variables) were the major drivers of flounder occurrence in the estuarine nursery. Although the adjacent coastal area is characterized by a current system with strong seasonality and mesoscale variability, we did not identify any influence of variables related with physical processes (currents and upwelling) on the occurrence of early life stages in the estuary. A wider knowledge on the influence of the coastal circulation variability and its associated effects upon ocean-estuarine connectivity is required to improve our understanding of the population dynamics of marine spawning fish that use estuarine nurseries.","Amorim, Eva;Bordalo, Adriano A;Elliott, Michael;Ramos, Sandra","Scholarly Journals","2016","107","2000151948","proquest","PG","ES","n","estuary","y","fish larvae and post-settlement spawning, survival and growth, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a and ""inland hydrological variables""","unknown","n","coastal circulation variability was referenced as a source of connectivity","chl_39"
"51","influence of a drought event on hydrological characteristics of a small estuary on the amazon mangrove coast","The effects of atypical climatic conditions, such as those of a drought event, are remarkably accentuated in minor estuaries filled with sediments and with reduced or sporadic freshwater input, where the salinity intrusion is pronounced. To understand these effects, hydrological and hydrodynamic parameters were evaluated during a drought period in a small estuary located on the eastern Amazon coast in northern Brazil. Five campaigns were conducted between June 2012 and June 2013. Samples were collected from the surface and bottom layer every 3 h over a 25-h period at three stations of the Tapera double dagger u Estuary. To compare drought and post-drought periods, in terms of salinity and chlorophyll-a, data was recorded until June 2015. Tapera double dagger u is a relatively shallow estuary of the Amazon coastal zone, which is characterized by the absence of any direct fluvial discharge, although it does receive freshwater input from adjacent wetlands, as well as less saline waters from the Caet, Estuary through the Taici Creek. Hydrological variables were controlled by rainfall levels and the tidal range, and the water became more saline and more oxygenated, with reduced dissolved nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations when precipitation decreased. A significant variation was found between the months of June 2012 (most intense drought) and 2013 (less intense drought). The connection to the neighboring Caet, Estuary and adjacent mangroves and wetlands contributed to the influx of nutrient-enriched waters. Overall, then, it is hoped that the results of this study can contribute to the understanding of the effects of drought events in other minor estuaries on the highly indented Amazon coast, as well as in other areas of the equatorial zone with similar environmental characteristics.","Carneiro Pereira, Luci Cajueiro; Rodrigues da Costa, Adila Kelly; da Costa, Rauquirio Marinho; Magalhaes, Andre; Flores-Montes, Manuel de Jesus; Jimenez, Jose A.","Scholarly Journals","2018","41","BIOSIS:PREV201800387074","wos","ES","DC","Y","estuary","Y","salinity, chl-a","precipitation, tidal range","Y","look at full paper","chl_40"

"54","influence of hydrological heterogeneity on rotifer community structure in three different water bodies in shantou area, guangdong (china)","Rotifers, small but essential invertebrates in aquatic ecosystems, are sensitive to environmental changes and are proposed to be indicators of trophic state. However, the effects of hydrological heterogeneity on the rotifer community and the ability of rotifer indices to reflect trophic state across different water bodies are still unclear. Here, we investigated rotifer community structure in different seasons in the three types of water bodies: Han river downstream (HD), Reservoir (RE) and Tidal creek (TC) in Shantou City, Guangdong, China. Our findings revealed that rotifer community structure differes significantly among the three water bodies, resulting from a dominance of Keratella cochlearis, Anuraeopsis fissa and Polyarthra vulgaris, who largely accounted for the differences in water bodies. Chlorophyll-a and transparency were the main environmental drivers in RE rotifer communities, while total nitrogen, total phosphorus and salinity were the main factors in HD and TC communities. Rotifer abundance and the rotifer trophic state index decreased in the order: RE > HD > TC. However, both the Sladecek's B/T quotient and the Keratella-index decreased in the order: HD > RE > TC, which was in accordance with the Carlson's trophic index. We conclude that it is efficient to use rotifer composition in water quality assessments when comparing different water bodies. Alpha diversity of rotifers was the highest in HD, which is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Hydrological heterogeneity is the micro-factor that regulates rotifer community structures in the Shantou area.","Liang, Diwen; Wei, Nan; Wang, Qing; Jersabek, Christian D.; He, Xuejia; Yang, Yufeng","Scholarly Journals","2019","58","BIOSIS:PREV201900931662","wos","PG","LY","n","river, reservior and tidal creek","y","rotifer community structure, Chlorophyll-a, transparency, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and salinity ","location","y",NA,"chl_42"
"55","intra-annual variation of chlorophyll-a and nutrients in a hydraulically perturbed river-floodplain system in the grijalva river basin","Background: The lateral connectivity in the Maluco river-floodplain system was partially reduced by the highway built on a natural barrier. Goal: To determine if the concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and nutrients contrast in different water levels (WL) during a hydrologic year in the Maluco river-floodplain system. Methods: The WL, Chl-a, and nutrients (NO2-, NO3-, NH(4)(+)and TP) were simultaneously measured six times in two sites during two years. The expected differences of Chl-a and nutrients concentrations, related to the intra-annual fluctuation of the WL, were tested through multivariate techniques. The hypothesis holds that there will be no intra-annual differences of Chl-a and nutrients due to the reduction of lateral interconnection by the physical effect of the embankment. Results: No variable was discarded during PCA. The intra-annual distribution of samples was similar according to the similarity profile routine. Furthermore: 1) more than 54% of the Chl-a and TP values indicated hypereutrophic conditions throughout the year, and 2) none of the values of WL surpassed the height of the bankfull (4.5 mast). The maximum concentrations of Chl-a were registered at the minimum WL values. Conclusions: The intra-annual similarity of Chl-a and inorganic nutrients can be linked to the disconnection between the floodplain and the Grijalva river since the bankfull was not overflowed throughout the sampling time. The intra-annual trend independent at the time of persistence of the high Chl-a and TP concentrations ill the river-floodplain system opens up the opportunity to estimate the minimum input flow required to biogeochemical processes in a long-term study.","Cruz-Ramirez, Allan K.; Angel Salcedo, Miguel; Sanchez, Alberto J.; de Dios Mendoza, Juan; Barba, Everardo; Alvarez-Pliego, Nicolas; Florido, Rosa","Scholarly Journals","2019","29","BIOSIS:PREV202100568878","wos","PG","LY","n","river-floodplain","y","Chl-a, and nutrients (NO2-, NO3-, NH(4)(+)and TP) ","water level","y",NA,"chl_43"

"58","land-sea connectivity, ecohydrology and holistic management of the great barrier reef and its catchments: time for a change","The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is an iconic and highly valued ecosystem in Queensland, Australia that is recognised internationally for its natural and cultural values. The coastal and marine ecosystems of the GBR are interconnected with the adjacent catchment area through hydrological connections. However, many GBR ecosystems are in a poor state, driven by several factors including a highly modified catchment. Land use changes over the last 160 years have led to development of agricultural land uses, modification of the coastal floodplains and loss of freshwater wetlands, and disruption of drainage and hydrological connections. These ecohydrological changes have led to declining water quality in catchment waterways and increases in the loads of pollutants that are delivered to the GBR, which predominantly occurs in wet season rainfall events. The Australian and State governments have recognised the need to address water quality issues for the GBR through management of the catchments, however, the management strategies adopted to date are largely associated with improvement of agricultural management practices and are not likely to be enough to maintain or restore the health of the GBR ecosystems. Future management strategies need to take into the account the need to protect, maintain and restore coastal ecosystems, system functions and land-sea connectivity if the values of the GBR are to be retained in the long term.

"59","lateral mobility of the light harvesting complex in chloroplast membranes controls excitation energy distribution in higher plants","Chloroplast [pea] thylakoid protein phosphorylation produces changes in light-harvesting properties and in membrane structure as revealed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Protein phosphorylation resulted in an increase in the 77.degree. K fluorescence signal at 735 nm relative to that at 685 nm. In addition, a decrease in connectivity between Photosystem II centers (PS II) and a dynamic quenching of the room temperature variable fluorescence was observed upon phosphorylation. Accompanying these fluorescence changes was a 23% decrease in the amount of stacked membranes. Microscopic analyses indicated that 8.0-nm particles fracturing on the P-face moved from the stacked into the unstacked regions upon phosphorylation. The movement of the 8.0-nm particles was accompanied by the appearance of chlorophyll b and 25 to 29 kD [kiloDalton] polypeptides in isolated stroma lamellae fractions. Phosphorylation of a population of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein complexes (LHC) in grana partitions causes the migration of these pigment proteins from the PS II-rich appressed membranes into the Photosystem I (PS I) enriched unstacked regions. This increases the absorptive cross section of PS I. In addition, we suggest that the mobile population of LHC functions to interconnect PS II centers in grana partitions; removal of this population of LHC upon phosphorylation limits PS II .fwdarw.

It is, however, currently hindered by a lack of direct evidence on ecological impacts associated with this type of project particularly on water quality and fish communities. Here, we characterized patterns and variations of fish communities and water quality in five impounded lakes of the Chinese South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), with the aim of better understanding potential ecological impacts of inter-basin water transfers. We found that 1) the impacts of water transfer on water quality in the impounded lakes was generally characterized by hydrological parameters (e.g. total suspended solids, turbidity, transparency, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and total hardness) in an upstream-downstream direction; 2) increased hydrological connectivity may have favored biological invasion (e.g. Tridentiger bifasciatus) and promoted a potential biotic homogenization among the impounded lakes; and 3) there was a pattern of decreased fish abundance and biomass from the upstream to downstream lakes with fish communities strongly driven by changing water quality patterns across the impounded lakes. These findings improve our understanding of ecological impacts of large-scale hydraulic projects and provide a significant basis for water agencies with similar water transfer systems to optimize their water transfer management in order to minimize ecological impacts.","Guo, Chuanbo;Chen, Yushun;Gozlan, Rodolphe E;Liu, Han;Lu, Ying;Qu, Xiao;Wang, Lizhu;Xia, Wentong;Xie, Songguang;Xiong, Fangyuan","Scholarly Journals","2020","713","2388744981","proquest","PG","CP","n","lake","y","total suspended solids, turbidity, transparency, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, total hardness, fish abundance and biomass"," inter-basin water transfers","y","connectivity metric is water transfer management, but includes response variables of interest to us","chl_49"
"64","periphyton response to simulated nonpoint source pollution: local over regional control","We investigated functional and structural responses of periphyton communities to simulated nonpoint source (NPS) pollution over a 2-year period. Periphyton communities were examined in three unique but hydrologically connected habitats in the lower Muskegon River: river, wetland, and lake. Our study addressed several major questions: (1) what are the effects of nonpoint source pollutants on periphyton structure and function, (2) to what degree do environmental conditions, including the pollutant delivery system and hydrologic conditions, affect periphyton response, and (3) do periphyton communities show synchronous responses to nonpoint source pollution? Nutrients were added over a 21-day period in each of the four seasons over 2 years. The effect of road salt on metabolism was evaluated in the winter and spring seasons in the river habitat only. In general, the periphyton community showed complex responses to the NPS amendments, but there was little evidence of nutrient limitation in this system based on community structure, biomass accrual, metabolism, or alkaline phosphatase activity. This result was unexpected given the relatively low ambient concentrations of phosphorus. We discuss the possibilities that nutrient delivery was ineffective or that herbivory and/or irradiance might have constrained periphyton growth, but ultimately conclude that our results suggest that periphyton communities in the lower Muskegon River watershed were (1) nutrient-replete, (2) tolerant of short-term salt additions, and (3) influenced more by local conditions (habitat) than by regional (watershed) factors. In systems where nonpoint source pollutant delivery is diffuse and hydrologic residence time is short, the influence of nonpoint source pollutants on periphyton may be either modest or too difficult to detect using traditional endpoints.","Steinman, Alan D.; Ogdahl, Mary E.; Wessell, Kelly; Biddanda, Bopi; Kendall, Scott; Nold, Stephen","Scholarly Journals","2011","45","BIOSIS:PREV201100740998","wos","RP","ES","N","all","Y","chla/salt","categorical","Y","much more about pollution and salts but may be relevant","chl_50"
"65","phytoplankton dynamics in the congo river","We report a dataset of phytoplankton in the Congo River, acquired along a 1700-km stretch in the mainstem during high water (HW, December 2013) and falling water (FW, June 2014). Samples for phytoplankton analysis were collected in the main river, in tributaries and one lake, and various relevant environmental variables were measured. Phytoplankton biomass and composition were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and marker pigments and by microscopy. Primary production measurements were made using the ¹³C incubation technique. In addition, data are also reported from a 19-month regular sampling (bi-monthly) at a fixed station in the mainstem of the upper Congo (at the city of Kisangani). Chl a concentrations differed between the two periods studied: in the mainstem, they varied between 0.07 and 1.77 µg L¹ in HW conditions and between 1.13 and 7.68 µg L¹ in FW conditions. The relative contribution to phytoplankton biomass from tributaries (mostly black waters) and from a few permanent lakes was low, and the main confluences resulted in phytoplankton dilution. Based on marker pigment concentration, green algae (both chlorophytes and streptophytes) dominated in the mainstem in HW, whereas diatoms dominated in FW; cryptophytes and cyanobacteria were more abundant but still relatively low in the FW period, both in the tributaries and in the main channel. Daily integrated production measured in the mainstem (n = 15) varied between 64.3 and 434.1 mg C m² day¹ in FW conditions and between 51.5 and 247.6 mg C m² day¹ in HW. Phytoplankton biomass in the Congo River mainstem was likely constrained by hydrological factors (accumulation due to increased retention time during FW, dilution by increased discharge during HW), even though increased nutrient availability in the FW period might have also stimulated phytoplankton production. In contrast to other tropical river systems where connectivity with the floodplain and the presence of natural lakes and man-made reservoirs play a prominent role in the recruitment of phytoplankton to the main river, our results show that phytoplankton growth in the Congo River can take place in the main channel, with hydrological processes allowing maintenance of phytoplankton biomass even during HW.","Descy, Jean-Pierre;Darchambeau, François;Lambert, Thibault;Stoyneva-Gaertner, Maya P;Bouillon, Steven;Borges, Alberto V","Scholarly Journals","2017","62","2000461867","proquest","DC","CP","n","lake and river","y","chlorophyll-a","proximity to main-stem river","y",NA,"chl_51"

Daily samplings were performed in limnetic zone of both lakes during the rainy season immediately after lateral inflow of water and, in the dry period, six months after hydrologic connectivity recovery. In order to identify the factors that affect rotifer population dynamics, lake water level, volume, depth, temperature, transparency, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, conductivity, suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a were determined. Variations of water physical and chemical factors that affect rotifer population were related to the lake-river degree of connection and to water level rising after drought. The water lateral inflow from the river resulted in an increase in lake water volume, depth, and transparency and a decrease in water pH, alkalinity, and suspended solids. The lake with the wider river connection, more frequent biota exchange, and larger amount of particulate and dissolved materials was richer and more diverse, while rotifer density, biomass, and productivity were lower in both periods studied. Density, biomass, and secondary production were higher in the lake with the smaller river connection and the higher physical and chemical stability. Our results show that the connectivity affects the limnological stability, associated to seasonality. Stable conditions, caused by low connectivity in dry periods, were related with high density, biomass and secondary production. Conversely, instability conditions in rainy periods were associated to elevated richness and diversity values, caused by exchange biota due to higher connectivity.","Casanova, Silvia Maria Caglierani;Panarelli, Eliana Aparecida;Henry, Raoul","Scholarly Journals","2009","39","883018575","proquest","ES","CP","N","lake","Y","rotifer density and biomass","water lateral inflow and river width","Y","look at full paper","chl_53"

The Usumacinta River Basin, in the Southern Gulf of Mexico, hosts several floodplain lakes, whose integrity is threatened by water resource development. We aimed to investigate how food webs in these ecosystems vary in relation to their hydrological connectivity and seasonal flood cycles. To do this, we combined analysis of water quality and stable isotopes in two lakes with permanent connection to the Usumacinta River and two isolated lakes during dry, early rainy and late rainy season. Significant differences in chlorophyll-a, nutrients and suspended solids were reflected in distinct trophic dynamics among lakes. Stable isotope analysis revealed that fish from all lakes relied predominantly on autochthonous primary production, but while phytoplankton was the dominant resource for fish in the isolated lakes, aquatic macrophytes made the highest contribution to consumers’ production in the connected lakes. Fish tended to have broader isotopic niches during the early rainy season, likely reflecting consumption of a wider range of resources following the first flow pulses of the year. Our study highlights the importance of hydrological connectivity and natural flow regimes to maintain the outstanding biodiversity and fishery yield of these floodplain ecosystems.","Cazzanelli, Matteo;Soria-Barreto, Miriam;Castillo, María Mercedes;Rodiles-Hernández, Rocío","Scholarly Journals","2021","848","2574330225","proquest","RP","LY","N","lake","Y","water quality and stable isotope","stable isotope","Y","all lakes but has chla and water quality","chl_55"

A Principal Components Analysis demonstrated that the system was more influenced spatially than temporally, with 74.57% of accumulated variance accounted for by the first two axes. High values of chloride, chlorophyll-a, BOD5, total phosphorus, and total organic carbon, as well as low dissolved-oxygen concentrations separated sites L and M from the others.

Besides the construction of the reservoir, the Melchior River, an extremely impacted system, affects the Descoberto River downstream from its entry. Important changes in water quality occur in the lower basin, especially downstream of the Descoberto Reservoir, with significant increases in nutrient concentrations, suspended solids, turbidity, and chlorophyll a, and therefore a decrease in water clarity.Original Abstract: Objetivo: A bacia do rio Descoberto foi estudada como um sistema descontinuo atraves de um ciclo sazonal (um ano) em 13 estacoes amostrais; Metodos: A conectividade foi analisada em relacao a caracteristicas ambientais e limnologicas ao longo eixo longitudinal do rio Descoberto e as variaveis que mais influenciaram as diferentes estacoes amostrais foram determinadas; Resultados: As estacoes K e L, localizadas a montante e jusante da entrada do rio Melchior, respectivamente, diferiram mais quanto aos parametros fisicos e qulmicos da agua. Uma analise de componentes principals (PCA) demonstrou que o sistema foi mais influenciado espacialmente que temporalmente, com 74,57% da variancia total acumulada nos dois primeiros eixos. Altos valores de cloreto, clorofila a, DBO5, fosforo total e carbono organico total, tanto quanto baixas concentracoes de oxigenio dissolvido separaram as estacoes L e M das demais. Inverno e primavera foram estacoes nas quais a maioria dos parametros apresentou diferencas significativas entre as estacoes; Conclusoes: A construcao do reservatorio e descargas de esgoto atuaram como fatores de descontinuidade afetando o referido sistema, principalmente no trecho medio do rio e no trecho inferior, entre estacoes K e L. O rio Melchior, a partir de sua entrada, afetou o rio Descoberto. Importantes mudancas na qualidade de agua ocorreram na bacia especialmente a jusante do reservatorio, com aumentos significativos de nutrientes, solidos suspensos, turbidez e clorofila a e, portanto, na diminuicao da transparencia da agua.","da Silva, WJ;Felisberto, SA;Fonseca, C P;das Gracas Machado de Souza, M","Scholarly Journals","2010","22","869576543","proquest","DC","CP","n","river","y","chlorophyll-a, BOD5, phosphorus, organic carbon, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, suspended solids","distance along river","y","also includes a temporal metric","chl_56"

A first exploration indicated that the phytoplankton community did not resist the impact of reservoirs and barely recovered downstream of them. The spatial analysis showed that the responses of the phytoplankton and environmental variables were not uniform. The two set of variables revealed spatial variability discontinuities and river fragmentation upstream and downstream from the reservoirs. Reservoirs caused the replacement of spatially heterogeneous habitats by homogeneous spatially distributed water bodies, these new environmental conditions downstream benefiting the opportunist and cosmopolitan algal taxa.

"74","short-term succession of aquatic plant species richness along ecosystem productivity and dispersal gradients in shallow lakes","Questions: The highest species richness is usually expected at an intermediate stage of development since the last major disturbance event, but some studies have shown that ecosystem productivity and dispersal may modify this pattern, suggesting the need for further studies on the effects of productivity and dispersal on the dynamics of species richness through succession. In this study, we analysed aquatic plant species richness in relation to (1) succession stage, measured as numbers of years since the last disturbance that affected the ecosystems; (2) lake productivity, measured as the chlorophyll a concentration; and (3) connectivity to similar nearby ecosystems, a proxy for the potential input of diaspores. Location: Shallow lakes of the Dombes region, France. Methods: Every 5-7 yr these shallow lakes are emptied and left to dry out for 1 yr. These drought disturbances lead to complete destruction of the submerged aquatic plant communities. Sixty lakes arranged along a gradient of productivity were selected. The probability of diaspore input was considered to increase from upstream to downstream, as lakes are organized in hydrologically connected networks via ditches, through which the downstream lakes receive water from the upstream lakes. For each lake, the aquatic plant species richness (from systematic summer vegetation sampling), time since the last disturbance (last summer drying), productivity (estimated as chlorophyll a concentration) and probability of diaspore input (assessed from position in the network) were recorded. Results: The aquatic plant species richness decreased with the time since the last disturbance for all of the lakes, but there was a significant interaction with the chlorophyll a concentration and position of the lake in the network. At the lowest ecosystem productivities, the relationship between successional stage and species richness was hump-shaped, whereas the species richness decreased with increasing time since the last disturbance when productivity increased. The lake's position in the network did not influence species richness during the first 2 yr after disturbance, but from year 3 and thereafter, lakes connected to high numbers of upstream lakes consistently exhibited decreased richness, contradicting the expected trend of increasing species richness with increasing diaspore inputs. Conclusions: This study indicates that both ecosystem productivity and connectivity strongly affected the relationship between aquatic plant species richness and succession, and that these factors should be taken into account in further developments of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.

"77","spatial connectivity in a large river system: resolving the sources and fate of dissolved organic matter","Large rivers are generally heterogeneous and productive systems that receive important inputs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial and in situ sources. Thus, they are likely to play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of the DOM flowing to the oceans. The asymmetric spatial gradient driven by directional flow and environmental heterogeneity contributes to the fate of DOM flowing downstream. Yet, the relative effects of spatial connectivity and environmental heterogeneity on DOM dynamics are poorly understood. For example, since environmental variables show spatial heterogeneity, the variation explained by environmental and spatial variables may be redundant. We used the St. Lawrence River (SLR) as a representative large river to resolve the unique influences of environmental heterogeneity and spatial connectivity on DOM dynamics. We used three-dimensional fluorescence matrices combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to characterize the DOM pool in the SLR. Seven fluorophores were modeled, of which two were identified to be of terrestrial origin and three from algal exudates. We measured a set of environmental variables that are known to drive the fate of DOM in aquatic systems. Additionally, we used asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM) modeling to take spatial connectivity into account. The combination of spatial and environmental models explained 85% of the DOM variation. We show that spatial connectivity is an important driver of DOM dynamics, as a large fraction of environmental heterogeneity was attributable to the asymmetric spatial gradient. Along the longitudinal axis, we noted a rapid increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), mostly controlled by terrestrial input of DOM originating from the tributaries. Variance partitioning demonstrated that freshly produced protein-like DOM was found to be the preferential substrate for heterotrophic bacteria undergoing rapid proliferation, while humic-like DOM was more correlated to the diffuse attenuation coefficient of UVA radiation.","Massicotte, Philippe;Frenette, Jean-Jacques","Scholarly Journals","2011","21","903662303","proquest","check","PG","n","river","y","dissolved organic matter (DOM), three-dimensional fluorescence matrices ","asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM) modeling","y","connectivity to downstream","chl_60"

"79","spatial distribution of nutrient limitation in the danube river floodplain in relation to hydrological connectivity","In this paper, we describe the influence of flooding on nutrient conditions and phytoplankton Chl-a concentrations in a hydrologically dynamic Danube floodplain in North-Eastern Croatia.

"82","spatial variability of chlorophyll-a and abiotic variables in a river-floodplain system during different hydrological phases","Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and abiotic variables were measured in the main channel and floodplain waterbodies of the Middle Parana River to analyse the system dynamics and to assess their spatial variability during different hydrological phases, including an extreme flood. We wanted to test that the flood does not always have a homogenising effect in a river-floodplain system. An explanatory model for Chl-a was performed according to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), and the relation of water level with the coefficient of variation (CV) among sites for each variable was explored. The model explained 64% of Chl-a variability. Water level, depth:euphotic zone ratio (Z (d):Z (eu)) (inverse correlation) and conductivity (direct correlation) were the significant explicative variables. The CV of Chl-a decreased with flood from the main channel to the floodplain, but for turbidity, Z (d):Z (eu), pH, dissolved oxygen, soluble reactive phosphorus and Chl-a:pheophytin-a ratio, it increased. However, within the floodplain, CV of turbidity, Z (d):Z (eu) and pH decreased during flood. These suggest that the homogenising effect frequently observed during inundation cannot be generalised and that the floodplain may maintain its identity even during flood. The extreme flood and its overlap with the warm season and sedimentological pulse probably contributed to the heterogeneity in the spatial gradient.","Mayora, Gisela; Devercelli, Melina; Giri, Federico","Scholarly Journals","2013","717","BIOSIS:PREV201300670242","wos","RP","LY","N","floodplain","Y","chla","coefficient of variation","Y",NA,"chl_63"
"83","spatial variability of zooplankton along a section of river sio under different habitat conditions","Many factors influence the abundance and species richness of zooplankton in river systems, including river hydrology, morphology, phytoplankton development and biotic interactions. River Sio discharges into Lake Victoria and forms a boundary between Kenya and Uganda at its middle and lower reaches. The river has an average discharge of 11.4 m3s-1 contributing 1.5% of riverine water input into Lake Victoria. Zooplankton community studies were carried out along a section of River Sio and its floodplain on the Ugandan side between November 2008 and January 2009. The main focus of the study was that River Sio zooplankton diversity; biomass and abundance patterns were expected to change with differing levels of lateral connectivity and habitat heterogeneity of the river plus its floodplain. Sampling along lateral and longitudinal transects of the river were done to investigate the effect of habitat heterogeneity subject to the river's flooding regimes on the abundance, composition and diversity of its zooplankton. Zooplankton samples were collected using a zooplankton net of mesh size 60/lm and a Schindler trap sampler for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Other factors determined were selected physico-chemical variables. Zooplankton and physical-chemical data were subjected to statistical analyses (ANOVA, multivariate, regression and correlation analyses) for significant tests after log transformation. The ordination of samples (sites and dates) of physical-chemical or biological variables was carried out using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Similarity and diversity indices were used to assess structural patterns. In total, 45 rotifer, 9 copepod and 7 cladocera species were identified. Mean zooplankton density and biomass of River Sio were lower in the main channel of the river compared to its floodplain sites. Significant habitat differences were observed for zooplankton composition and abundance but no seasonal biomass and density differences were identified. Nutrient levels of River Sio were found to be very low. Physicalchemical factors like chlorophyll-a showed strong influences on the zooplankton community structure. These findings suggest that both low and high river water levels and the availability of heterogeneous habitats are crucial for zooplankton development in River Sio. The high zooplankton density observed bears significance to the ecological functions of the river as a breeding and nursery ground for potamodromous fishes from Lake Victoria.","Gimbo, R","Books","2009",NA,"968183622","proquest","MB","LY","n","river and floodplain","y","zooplankton community","unclear; water level, lateral connectivity","y","Describes the impact of floodplain innundation on zooplankton.

"84","suspended sediment, nutrients, and chlorophyll in tropical floodplain lakes with different patterns of hydrological connectivity","The ecological functioning of floodplain lakes is largely influenced by the interaction with the river mainstem. In this study, seasonal variation in water chemistry and the relationship with the river conditions were compared between floodplain lakes that differ in the level of connection to the Usumacinta River, the largest river of Mesoamerica. Samples for suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll a were collected through the year in lakes permanently connected to the river and in lakes that only received water from the Usumacinta for a short period during peak flow. Floodplain lakes showed higher total suspended solids than the river during the dry season while during the rainy season greater differences were observed between the river and the lakes, probably explained by higher concentrations in the river and greater sedimentation in the lakes. Greater organic matter content in the suspended solids was observed in the floodplain lakes, particularly in the more isolated lakes, likely related to high algal biomass. Nitrate concentrations were always higher in the river than in the lakes and lower nitrate concentrations occurred at the isolated lakes, suggesting that processes that remove nitrate occur through the year and are a common feature of floodplain lakes. Phosphorus in the connected lakes was higher than in the river only during the dry season, while in the isolated lakes concentrations were always greater than in the river. Chlorophyll a concentrations were higher in the connected lakes than in the river only during the dry season, while the more isolated lakes exhibited higher values through the year, showing signs of eutrophication. Suspended organic matter, nitrate, and chlorophyll showed larger differences between lake and river sites in the more isolated lakes, probably related to greater water residence time and its influence on primary production. Less connected lakes are more vulnerable to flow alteration because the brief period of connection to the river can be compromised and the effects of eutrophication exacerbated.","Castillo, María M","Scholarly Journals","2020","82","2439434677","proquest","DC","PG","n","lake and river","y","chlorophyll-a, nitrite, organic matter, phosporus","spatial isolation/connection","y",NA,"chl_65"
"85","temporal coherence between lake and landscape primary productivity","Understanding the patterns and drivers of primary productivity is a major goal of ecology, but little is known about whether the primary productivities of different types of ecosystems—here, lakes and the landscapes in which they are embedded—fluctuate in related ways through time. Due to shared climatic variation and well-known connections between lake and terrestrial ecosystems, such as nutrient and resource subsidies, we hypothesized that interannual fluctuations in aquatic and terrestrial primary productivity indices could be coherent. We also expected that lake and watershed characteristics could modify the strength and nature of primary productivity relationships. We applied wavelet coherence analyses to time series of lake chlorophyll-a and satellite-derived NDVI to examine coherence between lakes and land, and used random forest regression and generalized additive models to evaluate why coherence varies among lakes. There can be substantial coherence between lake and terrestrial primary productivity, but the strength and phase (direction and time lag) of this relationship vary widely, and there were marked differences between short (2–4-year periods of oscillation) and long (&gt; 4-year periods of oscillation) timescales. Across all timescales, variables associated with the connectedness of lakes to their watersheds were consistently the important explanatory variables of the strength and phase of coherence. The patterns observed in this study suggest the importance of cross-ecosystem flows, as opposed to shared climatic variation, in determining temporal coherence between lakes and the landscape.","Walter, Jonathan A;Fleck, Rachel;Kastens, Jude H;Pace, Michael L;Wilkinson, Grace M","Scholarly Journals","2021","24","2517102093","proquest","DC","ES","n","lake","y","chlorophyll-a and NDVI","adjacency (somewhat unclear)","y","The connectivity metrics are not well defined, they are statistically derived from the landscapes surrounding the lakes","chl_66"
"86","terrestrialization alters organic matter dynamics and habitat quality for freshwater mussels (unionoida) in floodplain backwaters","Anthropogenically induced reduction in flood inundation frequency often leads to terrestrialisation, which accompanies establishment and expansions of tree cover on areas formerly with little or no trees. We tested hypotheses that terrestrialisation degrades habitat for freshwater mussels (Unionoida: Unio douglasiae nipponensis and Lanceolaria grayana) by changing the organic matter (OM) dynamics in floodplain backwaters.Stable isotope composition of seston, periphyton, fine and coarse benthic particulate OM (FBPOM and CBPOM) and mussel tissues was measured to understand OM dynamics and food webs in 14 backwaters in the middle segment of the Kiso River, Japan. Isotope ratios, C:N ratio and chlorophyll a as a proxy of food resource characteristics and the frequency of hypoxia were related to mussel growth rates.delta C-13 of seston, periphyton and FBPOM was low at sites with lower inundation frequency (a greater degree of terrestrialisation), whereas such a trend was not observed for CBPOM (i.e. riparian leaf litter). Mussels fed exclusively on seston or mixtures of seston and periphyton with their delta C-13 tracking fluctuations in food resources.Sestonic delta C-13 differences were attributed to changes in dominant carbon origin from predominantly river-borne to autochthonous sources, while periphytic delta C-13 differences were possibly caused by a varying level of dependence on respiratory CO2. FBPOM-delta C-13 differences were associated with a greater contribution of CBPOM to the FBPOM pool in infrequently flooded backwaters. Variability in mussel growth was more closely related to hypoxia than food resource characteristics.We inferred that terrestrialisation changes quality of seston and benthic detritus and degrades habitat conditions largely by accumulating riparian leaf litter in the benthic detrital pool and increasing the frequency of hypoxia. The removal of riparian trees may temporarily improve habitat condition in backwaters heavily affected by terrestrialisation. However, ecological integrity in the long run requires the recovery of the process that suppresses terrestrialisation, which includes restoration of incised channels and flood pulses.","Negishi, Junjiro N.; Katsuki, Kotaro; Kume, Manabu; Nagayama, Shigeya; Kayaba, Yuichi","Scholarly Journals","2014","59","BIOSIS:PREV201400370733","wos","ES","CP","Y","riverine","Y","mussel growth rate","inundation frequency","N","C:N ratio, isotopic composition, and Chl-a related to mussel growth","chl_67"
"87","the hydrochemical response of small and shallow floodplain water bodies to temporary surface water connections with the main river","We investigated the effects of temporary surface water connections with the main river on the water chemistry of large and small waterbodies in a Danube floodplain by comparing hydrochemical data before, during and after water exchange with the Danube during two large floods in 2009 and 2013. In addition, we studied the effects of an increased frequency of flood pulses on the water chemistry of the floodplain via long-term monitoring data. We used conservative (i.e. biologically non-reactive) parameters (alkalinity, Ca, Cl, K, Mg, Na, SO4, conductivity) to identify hydrochemical changes due to the mixing with river water. Changes in non-conservative parameters (PO4-P, NO3-N, NO2-N, NH4-N, total phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a), which deviated from pure mixing effects, were ascribed to alterations of biogeochemical processes induced by the imported river water. In large floodplain waterbodies, both conservative and non-conservative parameters changed towards Danube water concentrations during the connection with the main river and returned to pre-connection levels after the water exchange ended. Only chlorophyll-a concentrations were almost twice as high in the post-connection phase than before the connection. In small floodplain waterbodies, conservative and non-conservative parameters showed similar changes during the connection with the main river. However, the concentrations of PO4-P, total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a did not return to pre-connection levels, but increased further in the post-connection phase, exceeding even Danube water concentrations. We attribute these changes to phosphorus releases from the sediments and enhanced primary and bacterial production induced by the river water. In years with an increased flooding frequency, both conservative and non-conservative parameters approached Danube water concentrations in large floodplain waterbodies due to the increased surface water exchange. In small floodplain waterbodies, conservative parameters remained unaffected by the increased connection with the river, while nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations were considerably higher in wet years than in dry years. We conclude that the temporary input of oxygen- and nutrient-rich river water to small, mainly isolated backwaters can induce changes in benthic biogeochemical processes, which may provoke an internal eutrophication of these waterbodies.","Weigelhofer, Gabriele; Preiner, Stefan; Funk, Andrea; Bondar-Kunze, Elisabeth; Hein, Thomas","Scholarly Journals","2015","60","BIOSIS:PREV201500321559","wos","ES","PG","N","riverine","Y","multiple ","Chl-a, nuts","Y",NA,"chl_68"
"88","the impact of inundation-isolation cycles on the culturable bacterioplankton in the danube river floodplain","The investigation was conducted in the Kopacki Rit Nature Park (eastern Croatia) which is established to protect the floodplain area of the Danube River. The samples were collected monthly in four sites (channels and lakes) with increasing distance from the river. The aim of investigation was to examine trophic structure of culturable bacterioplankton in relation to inundation-isolation cycles on sampling sites with unequal degree of connection with the Danube river. A change in the ratio of copiotrophs (r- strategists) to oligotrophs (K-strategists) was expected as the different organic carbon sources emerged. The composition of variables was revealed by Principal Component Analysis of abiotic water properties (temperature, water depth, transparency, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nutrient concentrations) and the chlorophyll-a concentration. Scores of significant components were used in a Multiple Regression as independent variables and the relationship between the scores and abundance of colony forming units (CFUs) was examined. Regression model was significant only for copiotrophs, and their relative dominance was noticed in couple of samples on more isolated sampling sites. In all other samples oligotrophs were a dominant group, especially during the flood pulses or drainage after it. Their elevated abundance was equally distributed in all groups revealed by Principal Component Analysis, and corresponds to the fluvial action. Also concerning the two-way ANOVA (sites/samplings) oligotrophs are highly influenced by the sampling period i.e. inundation-isolation cycles. They are probably driven by the allochthonous organic matter provided by floods or have allochthonous origin itself. At the same time, copiotrophs are to some extent coupled with the established water properties, i.e. bottom-up controlled and their abundance is influenced by the localisation of sampling sites in the floodplain. These results describe the development of the conditions that promote habitat specific succession of the culturable bacterioplankton. Established differences had disappeared after additional inundation-isolation cycles.","Palijan, Goran; Bogut, Irella; Vidakovic, Jasna","Scholarly Journals","2008","56","BIOSIS:PREV200800604505","wos","ES","CP","N","riverine","Y","trophic structure of bacterioplankton","scores of abiotic WQ + Chl-a components (PCA)","y","look at full paper","chl_69"

"90","the lake-catchment (lakecat) dataset: characterizing landscape features for lake basins within the conterminous usa","Natural and human-related landscape features influence the ecology and water quality of lakes. Summarizing these features in a hydrologically meaningful way is critical to understanding and managing lake ecosystems. Such summaries are often done by delineating watershed boundaries of individual lakes. However, many technical challenges are associated with delineating hundreds or thousands of lake watersheds at broad spatial extents. These challenges can limit the application of analyses and models to new, unsampled locations. We present the Lake-Catchment (LakeCat) Dataset (https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/lakecat) of watershed features for 378,088 lakes within the conterminous USA. We describe the methods we used to: 1) delineate lake catchments, 2) hydrologically connect nested lake catchments, and 3) generate several hundred watershed-level metrics that summarize both natural (e.g., soils, geology, climate, and land cover) and anthropogenic (e.g., urbanization, agriculture, and mines) features. We illustrate how this data set can be used with a random forest model to predict the probability of lake eutrophication by combining LakeCat with data from US Environmental Protection Agency's National Lakes Assessment (NLA). This model correctly predicted the trophic state of 72% of NLA lakes, and we applied the model to predict the probability of eutrophication at 297,071 unsampled lakes across the conterminous USA. The large suite of LakeCat metrics could be used to improve analyses of lakes at broad spatial extents, improve the applicability of analyses to unsampled lakes, and ultimately improve the management of these important ecosystems.","Hill, Ryan A.; Weber, Marc H.; Debbout, Rick M.; Leibowitz, Scott G.; Olsen, Anthony R.","Scholarly Journals","2018","37","BIOSIS:PREV201800492376","wos","MB","CP","n","lakes","y","prabability of lake eutrophication","none","y","Unclear relevance; about characterizing lake cachments ","chl_70"
"91","the performance of ecological cage aquaculture of pejerrey odontesthes bonariensis in pampean lakes under two different hydrological scenarios","Ecological aquaculture promotes the development of sustainable farming systems, focusing on a wide range of ecosystem elements. The ecological aquaculture of the zooplanktivorous pejerrey ( Odontesthes bonariensis ) in floating cages in Pampean shallow lakes (Argentina) needs to be carried out considering the hydrological and chemical variations as modulators of plankton community and consequently of the pejerrey yield. To assess its performance in lakes with contrasting hydrological regimes, an experiment was carried out in two water bodies: La Salada de Monasterio Lake (Mon), an endorheic environment, and San Lorenzo Lake (Lor), connected to several lakes and the Salado River. During the experiment, regional rainfall generated high hydrological variability in Lor Lake changing its status of unconnected lake to a runâ€ofâ€theâ€river lake. High standard deviation in Chlorophyllâ€a values in Lor indicated the significant effects of hydrological instability on the plankton community. Microcrustaceans abundance and biomass were higher in Mon, and almost disappeared in Lor when it turns into runâ€ofâ€theâ€river. The final fish growth and survival were significantly higher in Mon, endorsing the importance of zooplankton of high nutritional quality and hydrological, physicalâ€“chemical and biological stability. The results indicate that productive and stable environments with a sustained offer of natural food are better for the zooplanktivorous fish production. Connectivity with other water bodies and hydrological dependence on rainfall regimes have defining effects on phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish production, thus emerging as key factors to be considered for achieving better results in the ecological aquaculture implementation.","Javier R Garcia de Souza;Moreno, Vivian Yorojo;Sathicq, MarÃ­a B;GÃ³mez, Nora;Sampietro, Susana;Donadelli, Jorge;Colautti, DarÃ­o C","Scholarly Journals","2021","52","2572363494","proquest","MB","RP","n","lake","y","chlorophyll a, microcrustacean abundance and biomass, fish growth and survival","connected/not connected","y","Included because paper describes the impact of changes in hydrologic connectivity on phytoplankton and the food web (zooplankton, fish).","chl_71"

"95","towards deconfounding hydrological and seasonal temperature variability in the determination of selected limnological variables of a temperate floodplain ecosystem","This paper presents a methodological approach that can aid the assessment of variation in limnological variables in response to hydrological phases and seasonal temperature variation. The investigation was conducted in the Danube River floodplain, Kopacki Rit, Croatia. The proposed approach facilitates a more accurate examination of the effects of first factor, while maintaining second factor less variable, and vice versa. Samples were collected in the floodplain channel and lake along a temporal connectivity gradient, and were grouped according to three hydrological phases (isolation, flow pulse and flood pulse) and according to three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). A permutational multivariate analysis of variance was used to analyse the hydrological effects within seasons, as well as seasonal effects within hydrological phases on selected limnological variables: pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nitrites, nitrates, ammonium, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a concentrations and ratio of copiotrophic to oligotrophic bacteria. A multivariate data cloud was structured by hydrological phases during all investigated seasons, but not by all seasons during different hydrological phases. The strongest impact of hydrological phases on limnological variables occurred during summer. Seasonal effects were significant during the isolation and the flood pulse phases. The flow pulse phase somehow obscured the effects of seasonal change, resulting in temporal floodplain homogenization. One possible explanation is that water temperature determines potential limnological conditions, whereas hydrology determines actual conditions. Such results must be taken into account if the accurate effects of hydrology and seasonal change are to be assessed in temperate floodplain ecosystems.

"96","transversal and lateral exciton energy transfer in grana thylakoids of spinach","The excitation energy transfer between photosystem (PS) II complexes was studied in isolated grana disks and thylakoids using chlorophyll a fluorescence induction measurements in the presence of DCMU under stacked and destacked conditions. Destacking of grana was achieved using a sonication protocol in a buffer without MgCl 2 . The degree of stacking was controlled and quantified by atomic force microscopy and by the concomitant absorption changes. As expected from the literature, intact thylakoids showed a strong dependency of the connectivity of PSII centers, the F m /F o ratio as well as the fraction of PSII(beta) centers on the MgCl 2 concentration. In contrast, these parameters did not change in isolated grana disks. In particular, the connectivity remained constantly high irrespective of the degree of destacking. These differences were explained by the high protein density in grana disks, which hinders separation and mixing of proteins sufficiently to change energy transfer properties. Due to the occurrence of stroma lamella in intact thylakoids, intermixing of PSII and PSI is possible and allows for changes in F m /F o ratio as is the separation of LHCII from PSII, thus leading to an increase in the fraction of PSII(beta). Even if mixing and separation of proteins are impaired in isolated grana disks, destacking should lead to a decrease in connectivity if transversal excitation energy transfer between two opposite membranes is significant. Because the connectivity is constant over all degrees of destacking employed, we conclude that the energy transfer in granas is mainly lateral.","Kirchhoff, H;Borinski, M;Lenhert, S;Chi, L;Büchel, C","Scholarly Journals","2004",NA,"925361516","proquest","RP","DC",NA,NA,"Y",NA,NA,"N","all about spinach","chl_76"

In this chapter, we have assessed the influence of hydrological connectivity with the main channel on the trophic state and water quality in the Lake Sakadas. The evaluation of trophic state combines a number of physical, chemical and biological parameters with the objective to select the relevant indicators for the floodplain lakes. The following environmental parameters have been considered: water temperature, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, water transparency, chlorophyll-a concentration, phytoplankton primary productivity, benthic and periphytic communities and laboratory experiments (nutrient enrichment bioassay). An integrative approach, which includes in situ research and laboratory experiments, indicated strong correlations of abiotic and biotic components with a hydrological regime. Also, during the biological monitoring, occurrence and spread of invasive species was noted as an indication of ecosystem disturbance (hydrological and/or anthropogenic). Therefore, our results contribute to the perception of importance of the hydrological connectivity (by inundation) on the eutrophication process in the investigated floodplain lake.","Persic, Vesna; Cerba, Dubravka; Bogut, Irella; Horvatic, Janja","Books","2011",NA,"BIOSIS:PREV201100325239","wos","RP","MB","N","floodplain","Y","chla and others","inundation","Y",NA,"chl_77"

"99","using stressor-response models to derive numeric nutrient criteria for lakes in the eastern plain ecoregion, china","Lakes in the Eastern Plain ecoregion of China are typically shallow, experience large disturbances, and are hydrologically connected to rivers. In recent years, lake eutrophication in this ecoregion has intensified due to human activities. To determine important regional nutrient criteria, the effects of hydrologic features and disturbances should be taken into account. In this paper, annual average data were used to construct stressor-response models for each hydrological lake type identified for lakes in the Eastern Plain ecoregion. In these models, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) criteria were obtained from a chlorophyll a (Chl-a, response variable) threshold value. A Chl-a concentration of 4.73 mu gL super(-1) was identified as this threshold value, which was based on the cyanotoxin limits associated with drinking water supply. The three lake types, which differed in hydrological structure, had significantly different TN and TP criteria. For example, lakes connected to the Yangtze River (T sub(1)) had a TN criterion ranging from 0.594 to 0.838mgL super(-1), which was substantially higher than those for lakes that were never connected to the river (T sub(3), 0.234-0.422mgL super(-1)). The exception to this trend occurred for lakes that were historically but not currently connected to the river (T sub(2)) due to P-limitation in this lake type. However, there was little variability in the TP criterion among T sub(1), T sub(2), and T sub(3) lakes, the values of which ranged from 0.021 to 0.037, 0.023 to 0.042, and 0.028 to 0.041mgL super(-1), respectively. This study hypothesized that the hydrological connectivity between lakes and rivers could regulate the relationships between stressors and their biological responses in lakes in the Eastern Plain ecoregion, leading to variability in appropriate nutrient criteria for different lake types. Setting nutrient criteria for the entire ecoregion and for different lake types by using stressor-response models will make the criteria values more credible and defensible.","Zhang, Yali;Huo, Shouliang;Ma, Chunzi;Xi, Beidou;Li, Xiang;Liu, Hongliang","Scholarly Journals","2014","42","1627975893","proquest","check","PG","n","lakes connected to a river",NA,"total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a","connected, historically connected or never connected","y",NA,"chl_78"
