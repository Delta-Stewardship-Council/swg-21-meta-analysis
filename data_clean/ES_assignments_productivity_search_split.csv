"1","biogeochemistry and biodiversity in a network of saline–alkaline lakes: implications of ecohydrological connectivity in the kenyan rift valley","The volcanic and tectonic lakes of the eastern branch of the African Great Rift Valley are exposed to multiple stressors and characterised by different levels of hydrological connectivity. Past volcanic activity generated endorheic basins, in which the nature of the bedrock, its connection with groundwater, and local climatic conditions, favoured the formation of highly alkaline soda waters. While little is known about their nutrient dynamics, most lakes in this area experience considerable microbial blooms and harbour diverse and specifically adapted microbial populations, some of which could embody novel biotechnological potential.Here we review the geochemical and (micro)biological features of a cluster of lakes distributed within the East African Rift, ranging from fresh to hypersaline, under different levels of hydrological connectivity. Possibly no other location on Earth has a comparable range of lake types in close proximity to each other and representing such a remarkable microbial biodiversity. Environmental heterogeneity and habitat connectivity among adjacent aquatic ecosystems may have positive implications in terms of regional environmental stability by enhancing the overall carrying capacity, i.e. the resilience to various forms of impact, contributing to biodiversity protection.Within these ecosystems, microbial processes encompass the entire basis of their primary production, in particular those driven by cyanobacteria. Combining a multi-disciplinary ecohydrological approach with a biogeochemical investigation of the principles underlying their functioning, our study can contribute to the development of appropriate environmental protection measures to effectively maintain their natural capital.","Fazi, Stefano;Butturini, Andrea;Tassi, Franco;Amalfitano, Stefano;Venturi, Stefania;Vazquez, Eusebi;Clokie, Martha;Wanjala, Silas W;Pacini, Nic;Harper, David M","Scholarly Journals",2018,18,"2067302535","proquest",6,"ES","RP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"2","dam builders and their works; beaver influences on the structure and function of river corridor hydrology, geomorphology, biogeochemistry and ecosystems","Beavers (Castor fiber, Castor canadensis) are one of the most influential mammalian ecosystem engineers, heavily modifying river corridor hydrology, geomorphology, nutrient cycling, and ecosystems. As an agent of disturbance, they achieve this first and foremost through dam construction, which impounds flow and increases the extent of open water, and from which all other landscape and ecosystem impacts follow. After a long period of local and regional eradication, beaver populations have been recovering and expanding throughout Europe and North America, as well as an introduced species in South America, prompting a need to comprehensively review the current state of knowledge on how beavers influence the structure and function of river corridors. Here, we synthesize the overall impacts on hydrology, geomorphology, biogeochemistry, and aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Our key findings are that a complex of beaver dams can increase surface and subsurface water storage, modify the reach scale partitioning of water budgets, allow site specific flood attenuation, alter low flow hydrology, increase evaporation, increase water and nutrient residence times, increase geomorphic heterogeneity, delay sediment transport, increase carbon, nutrient and sediment storage, expand the extent of anaerobic conditions and interfaces, increase the downstream export of dissolved organic carbon and ammonium, decrease the downstream export of nitrate, increase lotic to lentic habitat transitions and aquatic primary production, induce 'reverse' succession in riparian vegetation assemblages, and increase habitat complexity and biodiversity on reach scales. We then examine the key feedbacks and overlaps between these changes caused by beavers, where the decrease in longitudinal hydrologic connectivity create ponds and wetlands, transitions between lentic to lotic ecosystems, increase vertical hydraulic exchange gradients, and biogeochemical cycling per unit stream length, while increased lateral connectivity will determine the extent of open water area and wetland and littoral zone habitats, and induce changes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem assemblages. However, the extent of these impacts depends firstly on the hydro-geomorphic landscape context, which determines the extent of floodplain inundation, a key driver of subsequent changes to hydrologic, geomorphic, biogeochemical, and ecosystem dynamics. Secondly, it depends on the length of time beavers can sustain disturbance at a given site, which is constrained by top down (e.g. predation) and bottom up (e.g. competition) feedbacks, and ultimately determines the pathways of river corridor landscape and ecosystem succession following beaver abandonment. This outsized influence of beavers on river corridor processes and feedbacks is also fundamentally distinct from what occurs in their absence. Current river management and restoration practices are therefore open to re-examination in order to account for the impacts of beavers, both positive and negative, such that they can potentially accommodate and enhance the ecosystem engineering services they provide. It is hoped that our synthesis and holistic framework for evaluating beaver impacts can be used in this endeavor by river scientists and managers into the future as beaver populations continue to expand in both numbers and range.","Larsen, Annegret;Larsen, Joshua R;Lane, Stuart N","Scholarly Journals",2021,218,"2552303537","proquest",13,"ES","CP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"3","ecosystem metabolism and nutrient dynamics in the main channel and backwaters of the upper mississippi river","Photosynthesis and respiration are primary drivers of dissolved oxygen dynamics in rivers. We measured dissolved oxygen dynamics, aquatic ecosystem metabolism, algal abundance and nutrient concentrations at main channel and backwater sites on a reach of the Upper Mississippi River that borders the states of Wisconsin and Minnesota (U.S.A.). We asked (i) how ecosystem metabolism rates, dissolved oxygen dynamics and nutrient concentrations differed in the main channel and in backwaters, (ii) whether ecosystem metabolism relates to solar irradiance, nutrient concentration, algal abundance, temperature and river discharge and (iii) whether the relationships between ecosystem metabolism and these environmental factors differs between the main channel and backwaters. The rates of aquatic ecosystem metabolism in the main channel were among the highest reported for large rivers. Mean daily gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R) and net ecosystem production (NEP) in the main channel in the 2006 growing season were 10, 6 and 4g O(2)m(2) d(-1), respectively. Solar irradiance, discharge and temperature, rather than nutrients, accounted for most temporal variability in gross primary production (GPP). Discharge was negatively associated with GPP in the main channel and temperature positively associated with GPP in backwaters. Primary production consistently exceeded respiration in the main channel in summer, resulting in persistent oxygen supersaturation from late June to early August. Maximum chlorophyll concentrations (140g L-1) were observed in the main channel, rather than the backwaters. Nitrogen and phosphorus exhibited contrasting temporal patterns in backwaters probably reflecting differences in their sources and sinks; N declined during the growing season while P increased.","Houser, Jeffrey N.; Bartsch, Lynn A.; Richardson, William B.; Rogala, James T.; Sullivan, John F.","Scholarly Journals",2015,60,"BIOSIS:PREV201500646532","wos",20,"ES","LY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"4","flood disturbance affects macroinvertebrate food chain length in an alluvial river floodplain","Characterising food-web responses to environmental factors could greatly improve our understanding of environment-biota relationships, and especially in floodplains where trophic interactions can be particularly important during phases of hydrological disconnection. The effects of floodplain hydrology and environmental attributes on structural aspects of biotic assemblages have been extensively studied, but responses at the functional level remain largely unknown. Here, we characterised a central aspect of food-web architecture, the food chain length, as the maximum trophic position within 24 macroinvertebrate communities of parafluvial habitats in the Maggia river floodplain, in Switzerland. We investigated how the food chain length changed with different levels of habitat size, primary productivity and disturbance, the three factors potentially affecting food chain length in both theoretical and empirical studies. We found that food chain length was lower in frequently flooded habitats and immediately after a flood. We also showed that trophic omnivory, where predators fed at lower trophic levels after flooding, and in more frequently flooded habitats, may explain these changes. These findings show that trophic omnivory may explain how predators resist disturbance and are maintained in highly dynamic landscapes. More importantly, given that trophic omnivory may overall weaken trophic linkages and thus increase food-web stability, this suggests that it could be a key mechanism in sustaining biodiversity in river floodplains.","Chanut, Pierre C.

"5","hydrologic pulsing promotes spatial connectivity and food web subsidies in a subtropical coastal ecosystem","Resource pulsing is a widespread phenomenon, but its effects on ecosystem dynamics are often difficult to predict. Hydrological pulsing, in particular, is known to influence the structure and dynamics of fluvial and coastal ecosystems, but little information is available about its effects on trophic connectivity between wetlands and estuaries. We investigated the hypothesis that hydrologic pulsing drives 1-way trophic subsidies (e.g. suspended organic matter and freshwater fish) from wetland to estuary. Our study system is a coastal lagoon with an ephemeral mouth that, when closed, stores freshwater as a sustained flood pulse that is subsequently released when a connection with the sea is reestablished. We monitored isotopic composition of consumers and food sources over the course of an entire flood pulse to infer trophic linkages and spatial subsidies. Before the flood peak (April and May), freshwater and estuarine zones were largely dependent on local primary production sources (seston and C sub(3) plants vs. C sub(4) plants and microphytobenthos, respectively), essentially functioning as disconnected compartments. A sustained pulse of freshwater inflow (June to August) induced greater habitat connectivity and a net flow of biomass and energy from the freshwater zone into the estuarine zone. The opening of the lagoon outlet channel abruptly terminated the flood pulse and reduced freshwater subsidies to estuarine consumers, and both zones returned to dependence on autochthonous production. Our findings contribute to current concerns that artificial opening of sandbars in coastal lagoons alters natural ecological dynamics with significant effects on biodiversity and ecosystem processes.","Garcia, A M;Winemiller, K O;Hoeinghaus, D J;Claudino, M C;Bastos, R;Correa, F;Huckembeck, S;Vieira, J;Loebmann, D;Abreu, P;Ducatti, C","Scholarly Journals",2017,567,"1881748793","proquest",34,"ES","RP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"6","intra-annual patterns in the benthic-pelagic fluxes of dissolved and particulate matter","In coastal temperate environments, many processes known to affect the exchange of particulate and dissolved matter between the seafloor and the water column follow cyclical patterns of intra-annual variation. This study assesses the extent to which these individual short term temporal variations affect specific direct drivers of seafloor-water exchanges, how they interact with one another throughout the year, and what the resulting seasonal variation in the direction and magnitude of benthic-pelagic exchange. Existing data from a multidisciplinary long-term time-series from the Western Channel Observatory, UK, were combined with new experimental and in-situ data collected throughout a full seasonal cycle. These data were used to define an average year, split into five ‘periods’ (winter, pre-bloom, bloom, post-bloom and autumn) based around the known importance of pelagic primary production and hydrodynamically active phases of the year. Multivariate analyses were used to identify specific sub-sets of parameters that described the various direct drivers of seafloor-water exchanges. Both dissolved and particulate exchange showed three distinct periods of significant flux during the year, although the specific timings of these periods and the cause-effect relationships to the direct and indirect drivers differed between the two types of flux. Dissolved matter exchange was dominated by an upward flux in the pre-bloom period driven by diffusion, then a biologically induced upward flux during the bloom and an autumn downward flux. The latter was attributable to the interactions of hydrodynamic and biological activity on the seafloor. Particulate matter exchanges exhibited a strongly hydrologically influenced upward flux during the winter, followed by a biologically induced downward flux during the bloom and a second period of downward flux throughout post-bloom and autumn periods. This was driven primarily through interactions between biological activity, and physical and meteorological drivers. The integrated, holistic and quantitative data-based analysis of intra-annual variability in benthic/pelagic fluxes presented in this study in a representative temperate coastal environment, demonstrates not only the various process’ inter-connectivity, but also their relative importance to each other. Future investigations or modelling efforts of similar systems will benefit greatly from the relationships and baseline rules established in this study.","Rühl, Saskia;Thompson, Charlie E L;Queirós, Ana M;Widdicombe, Stephen","Scholarly Journals",2020,NA,"2464482260","proquest",41,"ES","PG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"7","local and regional drivers of environmental changes in two subtropical montane ponds (central china) over the last two centuries","Central China, one of the Earth's distinctive ecoregions due to its endemic subtropical biota, has been subjected to enhanced nitrogen deposition and climate warming during recent decades. However, the extent and timescale of ecological changes are largely unexplored. Multiproxy analyses (diatoms, photosynthetic pigments and geochemistry) of(210)Pb-dated sediment cores from two shallow ponds within an alpine basin (central China) were used to investigate the response of primary producer communities to external stressors during the last two centuries. The study sites include one drainage pond and one seepage pond. Both ponds exhibited unambiguous changes in production and composition of photoautotrophs since the early twentieth century, which are linked to climate warming, nitrogen deposition and local factors (for example, lake morphometry, desiccation and macrophyte). Although primary producers responded to regional warming and nitrogen deposition, the ecological responses differed among ponds due to local factors. In the deeper seepage pond, light attenuation due to terrestrial organic matter input caused recent decreases in carotenoids and small fragilarioid taxa. In contrast, the co-occurrence of euterrestrial and tychoplanktonic diatoms in the shallower drainage pond was indicative of its hydrological instability. Our results indicate that subtropical montane ponds in the East Asian monsoon region appear to be strongly influenced by a combination of local (for example, catchment-lake connectivity) and regional driving forces (for example, warming and nitrogen deposition).","Chen, Xu; McGowan, Suzanne; Peng, Jia; Zheng, Ting; Bai, Xue; Zeng, Linghan","Scholarly Journals",2021,24,"BIOSIS:PREV202100466662","wos",48,"ES","CP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"8","persistence of clear-water, shallow-lake ecosystems: the role of protected areas and stable aquatic food webs","The roles of both landscape alteration and in-lake processes need to be considered in conservation strategies for shallow lakes in the prairie regions of North America. Here we focus on shallow lakes in west-central Minnesota, USA, highlighting the long-term ecological history and response to known landscape changes of a clear-water, macrophyte-dominated, shallow lake. Contemporary limnological data suggest the aquatic ecosystem has been very stable and fishless for the last ~15 years. Sediment proxies for primary production and ecological change confirm that a stable ecosystem likely prevailed for the last ~200 years. However, sedimentary indicators of catchment erosion detail a distinct response to land-use change during the conversion of native grassland to agricultural land, and following establishment of a protected waterfowl production area (WPA) around the lake. Post-WPA, the rate of sediment accrual decreased dramatically within 5-10 years and sources of organic matter were similar to those of the pre-settlement period. The aquatic ecosystem has been able to withstand nutrient enrichment and allochthonous inputs because stable trophic interactions have likely been in place for more than 200 years. We conclude that lack of hydrologic connectivity and isolated, small catchments are important factors in the promotion of clear-water shallow lake ecosystems, mainly because they prevent colonization by fish and associated ecological consequences. This study highlights the importance of managing both the landscape and in-lake processes to maintain stable, clear-water, shallow lakes.","Hobbs, William O;Theissen, Kevin M;Hagen, Sean M;Bruchu, Charles W;Czeck, Ben C;Ramstack Hobbs, Joy M;Zimmer, Kyle D","Scholarly Journals",2014,51,"1663542542","proquest",55,"ES","CP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"9","spatial dissimilarities in plankton structure and function during flood pulses in a semi-arid floodplain wetland system","Floodplain wetlands in semi-arid regions have intricate channel-floodplain networks with highly variable and unpredictable wet and dry phases related to changes in hydrology and geomorphology. We tested the hypothesis that the presence of different hydro-geomorphic habitats in those systems drives structural and functional differences in aquatic communities. To test this hypothesis, we examined the densities and species composition (structural variables), and primary productivity and respiration (functional variables) of plankton communities, and water chemistry in three spatially explicit channel, floodout and lagoon habitat types inundated by environmental water releases in the Macquarie Marshes, semi-arid Australia. Significant differences were recorded among the community-level structural and functional variables among the three habitats. Greater densities of phytoplankton, zooplankton and planktonic bacteria were observed in a hydrologically isolated floodplain lagoon. The lagoon habitat also had greater primary productivity of phytoplankton and planktonic respiration compared with the channel and floodout. Our results suggest that water release to meet environmental flow requirements can be an important driver of planktonic diversity and functional responses in semi-arid wetland systems by inundating diverse, hydro-geomorphically distinct habitats.","Kobayashi, Tsuyoshi; Ralph, Timothy J.; Ryder, Darren S.; Hunter, Simon J.; Shiel, Russell J.; Segers, Hendrik","Scholarly Journals",2015,747,"BIOSIS:PREV201500285482","wos",62,"ES","MB",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"10","the influence of fluctuating ramping rates on the food web of boreal rivers","A BAC delta (before-after-control-impact) sampling design was applied to determine the possible effects of ramping rate (RR) regulation on food webs structure and function in a regulated boreal river. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures of primary producers, macroinvertebrates and fish to determine variations in the source of carbon fuelling the food web as well as changes in the food web structure under variable RR flow regime. We hypothesized that unrestricted RR would (1) increase the connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic environments allowing for a higher contribution of terrestrial carbon to support the food web and (2) decrease food web length because of frequent disturbances. Unrestricted RR had little influence on 13C values for the overall food web with most of the differences found between impacted sites compared and control sites, indicating that the proportion of various carbon sources entering the diet of consumers remained unchanged under unrestricted RR. In contrast, significantly higher 15N values were measured in impacted sites (invertebrates and fish) and as well as under unrestricted ramping flow regime (invertebrates). Further, unrestricted RR was associated to a significant decrease in the difference between macroinvertebrates and fish 15N signatures, equivalent to a reduction of the length of the food web by at least one trophic level. Results from this study indicate that RR should be taken into consideration in the regulation of operating regimes on rivers.","Marty, Jerome;Smokorowski, Karen;Power, Michael","Scholarly Journals",2009,25,"21066393","proquest",69,"ES","RP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"11","variations in dissolved greenhouse gases (co2, ch4, n2o) in the congo river network overwhelmingly driven by fluvial-wetland connectivity","We carried out 10&#xa0;field expeditions between 2010 and 2015 in the lowland part of the Congo River network in the eastern part of the basin (Democratic Republic of the Congo), to describe the spatial variations in fluvial dissolved carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ), methane ( CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide ( N 2 O ) concentrations. We investigate the possible drivers of the spatial variations in dissolved CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O concentrations by analyzing covariations with several other biogeochemical variables, aquatic metabolic processes (primary production and respiration), catchment characteristics (land cover) and wetland spatial distributions. We test the hypothesis that spatial patterns of CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O are partly due to the connectivity with wetlands, in particular with a giant wetland of flooded forest in the core of the Congo basin, the “Cuvette Centrale Congolaise” (CCC). Two transects of 1650 km were carried out from the city of Kisangani to the city of Kinshasa, along the longest possible navigable section of the river and corresponding to 41 % of the total length of the main stem. Additionally, three time series of CH 4 and N 2 O were obtained at fixed points in the main stem of the middle Congo (2013–2018, biweekly sampling), in the main stem of the lower Kasaï (2015–2017, monthly sampling) and in the main stem of the middle Oubangui (2010–2012, biweekly sampling). The variations in dissolved N 2 O concentrations were modest, with values oscillating around the concentration corresponding to saturation with the atmosphere, with N 2 O saturation level (% N 2 O , where atmospheric equilibrium corresponds to 100 %) ranging between 0 % and 561 % (average 142 %). The relatively narrow range of % N 2 O variations was consistent with low NH 4 + ( 2.3 ± 1.3 µ mol L - 1 ) and NO 3 - ( 5.6 ± 5.1 µ mol L - 1 ) levels in these near pristine rivers and streams, with low agriculture pressure on the catchment (croplands correspond to 0.1 % of catchment land cover of sampled rivers), dominated by forests ( ∼ 70 % of land cover). The covariations in % N 2 O , NH 4 + , NO 3 - and dissolved oxygen saturation level (% O 2 ) indicate N 2 O removal by soil or sedimentary denitrification in low O 2 , high NH 4 + and low NO 3 - environments (typically small and organic matter rich streams) and N 2 O production by nitrification in high O 2 , low NH 4 + and high NO 3 - (typical of larger rivers that are poor in organic matter). Surface waters were very strongly oversaturated in CO 2 and CH 4 with respect to atmospheric equilibrium, with values of the partial pressure of CO 2 ( p CO 2 ) ranging between 1087 and 22 899 ppm (equilibrium ∼ 400 ppm) and dissolved CH 4 concentrations ranging between 22 and 71 428 nmol L - 1 (equilibrium ∼ 2 nmol L - 1 ). Spatial variations were overwhelmingly more important than seasonal variations for p CO 2 , CH 4 and % N 2 O as well as day–night variations for p CO 2 . The wide range of p CO 2 and CH 4 variations was consistent with the equally wide range of % O 2 (0.3 %–122.8 %) and of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (1.8–67.8 mg L - 1 ), indicative of generation of these two greenhouse gases from intense processing of organic matter either in “terra firme” soils, wetlands or in-stream. However, the emission rate of CO 2 to the atmosphere from riverine surface waters was on average about&#xa0;10 times higher than the flux of CO 2 produced by aquatic net heterotrophy (as evaluated from measurements of pelagic respiration and primary production). This indicates that the CO 2 emissions from the river network were sustained by lateral inputs of CO 2 (either from terra firme or from wetlands). The p CO 2 and CH 4 values decreased and % O 2 increased with increasing Strahler order, showing that stream size explains part of the spatial variability of these quantities. In addition, several lines of evidence indicate that lateral inputs of carbon from wetlands (flooded forest and aquatic macrophytes) were of paramount importance in sustaining high CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations in the Congo river network, as well as driving spatial variations: the rivers draining the CCC were characterized by significantly higher p CO 2 and CH 4 and significantly lower % O 2 and % N 2 O values than those not draining the CCC; p CO 2 and % O 2 values were correlated to the coverage of flooded forest on the catchment. The flux of greenhouse gases (GHGs) between rivers and the atmosphere averaged 2469 mmol m - 2 d - 1 for CO 2 (range 86 and 7110 mmol m - 2 d - 1 ), 12 553 µ mol m - 2 d - 1 for CH 4 (range 65 and 597 260 µ mol m - 2 d - 1 ) and 22 µ mol m - 2 d - 1 for N 2 O (range - 52 and 319 µ mol m - 2 d - 1 ). The estimate of integrated CO 2 emission from the Congo River network ( 251 ± 46 TgC (10 12 gC) yr - 1 ), corresponding to nearly half the CO 2 emissions from tropical oceans globally (565 TgC yr - 1 ) and was nearly 2&#xa0;times the CO 2 emissions from the tropical Atlantic Ocean (137 TgC yr - 1 ). Moreover, the integrated CO 2 emission from the Congo River network is more than 3&#xa0;times higher than the estimate of terrestrial net ecosystem exchange (NEE) on the whole catchment (77 TgC yr - 1 ). This shows that it is unlikely that the CO 2 emissions from the river network were sustained by the hydrological carbon export from terra firme soils (typically very small compared to terrestrial NEE) but most likely, to a large extent, they were sustained by wetlands (with a much higher hydrological connectivity with rivers and streams).","Borges, Alberto V;Darchambeau, François;Lambert, Thibault;Morana, Cédric;Allen, George H;Tambwe, Ernest;Sembaito, Alfred Toengaho;Taylor Mambo;Wabakhangazi, José Nlandu;Descy, Jean-Pierre;Teodoru, Cristian R;Bouillon, Steven","Scholarly Journals",2019,16,"2301328534","proquest",76,"ES","MB",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"52","machine learning algorithm-based risk assessment of riparian wetlands in padma river basin of northwest bangladesh","Wetland risk assessment is a global concern especially in developing countries like Bangladesh. The present study explored the spatiotemporal dynamics of wetlands, prediction of wetland risk assessment. The wetland risk assessment was predicted based on ten selected parameters, such as fragmentation probability, distance to road, and settlement. We used M5P, random forest (RF), reduced error pruning tree (REPTree), and support vector machine (SVM) machine learning techniques for wetland risk assessment. The results showed that wetland areas at present are declining less than one-third of those in 1988 due to the construction of the dam at Farakka, which is situated at the upstream of the Padma River. The distance to the river and built-up area are the two most contributing drivers influencing the wetland risk assessment based on information gain ratio (InGR). The prediction results of machine learning models showed 64.48% of area by M5P, 61.75% of area by RF, 62.18% of area by REPTree, and 55.74% of area by SVM have been predicted as the high and very high-risk zones. The results of accuracy assessment showed that the RF outperformed than other models (area under curve: 0.83), followed by the SVM, M5P, and REPTree. Degradation of wetlands explored in this study demonstrated the negative effects on biodiversity. Therefore, to conserve and protect the wetlands, continuous monitoring of wetlands using high resolution satellite images, feeding with the ecological flow, confining built up area and agricultural expansion towards wetlands, and new wetland creation is essential for wetland management.","Islam, Abu Reza Md Towfiqul;Talukdar, Swapan;Mahato, Susanta;Ziaul, Sk;Eibek, Kutub Uddin;Akhter, Shumona;Pham, Quoc Bao;Mohammadi, Babak;Karimi, Firoozeh;Linh, Nguyen Thi Thuy","Scholarly Journals",2021,28,"2495403946","proquest",50,"MB","ES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"86","woody plant encroachment has a larger impact than climate change on dryland water budgets","Woody plant encroachment (WPE) into grasslands is a global phenomenon that is associated with land degradation via xerification, which replaces grasses with shrubs and bare soil patches. It remains uncertain how the global processes of WPE and climate change may combine to impact water availability for ecosystems. Using a process-based model constrained by watershed observations, our results suggest that both xerification and climate change augment groundwater recharge by increasing channel transmission losses at the expense of plant available water. Conversion from grasslands to shrublands without creating additional bare soil, however, reduces transmission losses. Model simulations considering both WPE and climate change are used to assess their relative roles in a late 21st century condition. Results indicate that changes in focused channel recharge are determined primarily by the WPE pathway. As a result, WPE should be given consideration when assessing the vulnerability of groundwater aquifers to climate change.","Schreiner-McGraw, Adam P;Vivoni, Enrique R;Ajami, Hoori;Sala, Osvaldo E;Throop, Heather L;Peters, Debra P C","Scholarly Journals",2020,10,"2404048751","proquest",77,"RP","ES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"78","tracking the resource pulse: movement responses of fish to dynamic floodplain habitat in a tropical river","Natural river floodplains are among the Earth's most biologically diverse and productive ecosystems but face a range of critical threats due to human disturbance. Understanding the ecological processes that support biodiversity and productivity in floodplain rivers is essential for their future protection and rehabilitation. Fish assemblage structure on tropical river floodplains is widely considered to be driven by dispersal limitation during the wet season and by environmental filtering and interspecific interactions during the dry season. However, the individual-level movement behaviours (e.g. site attachment, nomadism, homing) that regulate dispersal of fish on floodplains are poorly understood. We combined radiotelemetry and remote sensing to examine the movement behaviour of two large-bodied fishes (barramundi Lates calcarifer, forktail catfish Neoarius leptaspis) over the flood cycle in a tropical river-floodplain system in northern Australia to: (a) quantify movement responses in relation to dynamic habitat resources at a landscape scale; and (b) determine the extent of spatial 'reshuffling' of individual fish following the wet season. Both species altered their behaviour rapidly in response to changes in the availability and distribution of aquatic habitat, with most individuals undertaking extensive movements (up to similar to 27 km from the tagging location) on the inundated floodplain during the wet season. Although there was considerable individual variation in movement patterns, overall barramundi distributions closely tracked the extent of floodplain primary productivity, whereas catfish distributions were most closely associated with the extent of flooded area. Most individuals of both species exhibited homing back to previously occupied dry season refugia during the wet-to-dry transition, even though other potential refugia were available in closer proximity to wet season activity areas. We postulate that homing behaviour modulates temporal variation in fish assemblage composition and abundance and limits the transfer of aquatic-derived energy and nutrients into terrestrial food webs by reducing fish mortality on drying floodplains. Our study demonstrates the importance of quantifying individual-level behaviour across the three stages of dispersal (emigration, inter-patch movement, immigration) for our understanding of how animal movement influences energetic subsidies and other large-scale ecosystem processes.","Crook, David A.; Buckle, Duncan J.; Morrongiello, John R.; Allsop, Quentin A.; Baldwin, Wayne; Saunders, Thor M.; Douglas, Michael M.","Scholarly Journals",2020,89,"BIOSIS:PREV202000306187","wos",71,"MB","ES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
