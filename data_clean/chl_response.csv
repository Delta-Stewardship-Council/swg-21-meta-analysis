"66","chl_17","decrease in connected channel areas (higher in backwater). Exceptions may be due to times when N is limiting, when low discharge increases residence time in main channel, when high veg shades production."

with no hyporheic-surface water exchange (=VHG, neutral) (ANOVA, P\0.05). The assemblages of algae at upwelling sites were also significantly different from downwelling and neutral exchange sites (ANOSIM, P\0.05). Filamentous green algae Stigeoclonium sp. and Zygnema sp. and a chrysophyte, Hydrurus foetidus (Villars) Trevisan were abundant at upwelling sites, whereas an assemblage of diatoms Achnanthidium minutissimum (KuÂ¨tzing) Czarnecki, Cymbella excisa KuÂ¨tzing, Diatoma moniliformis KuÂ¨tzing, and Gomphonema olivaceoides Hustedt, were the most abundant taxa at downwelling and neutral exchange sites, occurring attached to, or in close association with the stalks of Didymosphenia geminata (Lyngbye) Schmidt."
"100","pro_4","Our results stress the importance of primary production in sustaining Bacterial secondary production in backwaters with a connectivity gradient. Nonetheless,the only modest variation of Bacterial secondary production compared to more dynamic primary production (the rate of carbon fixed in particulate organic matter (pPP), the rate of dissolved organic carbon released extracellularly by phytoplankton, and chl a) demonstrates that organic matter derived from sources other than phyto-planktonal sosupported  Bacterial secondary production in this river-floodplain system. chla (ugl -1) was highest in system I, intermediate in system II and lowerst in system III (statistically significant, data in Figure 2B)"
