seasonal variations in food web dynamics of floodplain lakes with contrasting hydrological connectivity in the southern gulf of mexico,"Floodplains are some of the most productive and diverse ecosystems on Earth. The Usumacinta River Basin, in the Southern Gulf of Mexico, hosts several floodplain lakes, whose integrity is threatened by water resource development. We aimed to investigate how food webs in these ecosystems vary in relation to their hydrological connectivity and seasonal flood cycles. To do this, we combined analysis of water quality and stable isotopes in two lakes with permanent connection to the Usumacinta River and two isolated lakes during dry, early rainy and late rainy season. Significant differences in chlorophyll-a, nutrients and suspended solids were reflected in distinct trophic dynamics among lakes. Stable isotope analysis revealed that fish from all lakes relied predominantly on autochthonous primary production, but while phytoplankton was the dominant resource for fish in the isolated lakes, aquatic macrophytes made the highest contribution to consumers’ production in the connected lakes. Fish tended to have broader isotopic niches during the early rainy season, likely reflecting consumption of a wider range of resources following the first flow pulses of the year. Our study highlights the importance of hydrological connectivity and natural flow regimes to maintain the outstanding biodiversity and fishery yield of these floodplain ecosystems.","Cazzanelli, Matteo;Soria-Barreto, Miriam;Castillo, María Mercedes;Rodiles-Hernández, Rocío",Scholarly Journals,2021,848,2574330225,proquest,RP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
connectivity and habitat typology drive co sub 2 sub and ch sub 4 sub fluxes across land water interfaces in lowland rivers,"Lowland rivers are assumed to be a net source of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ). However, little is known about the contribution of marginal permanent and temporary riverine aquatic systems to river carbon metabolism. Elevation, in relation to flooding, hydro‐morphological, and ecological features of such habitats, can affect the gas fluxes across the water–atmosphere interfaces and the periodically air‐exposed riverbeds. This hypothesis was investigated in the lowland sector of the Po River (Northern Italy) from May to September 2008. Five different aquatic habitats were considered: the main river course; a backwater habitat; and three lateral lentic waterbodies—an oxbow and two quarry lakes of different age. The water mass was always CO 2 and CH 4 supersaturated, and gas fluxes were from the water to the atmosphere. In the highly dynamic river course and backwaters, CO 2 emission rates were nearly one order of magnitude greater than in the lentic and hypoxic oxbow and quarry lakes. By contrast, CH 4 fluxes peaked in the lentic, deeper, and permanent water bodies. At sediment–atmosphere interfaces, the CO 2 emissions increased along an organic matter, a water saturation, and a chlorophyll a gradient, attaining the maximum rates in the periodically air‐exposed riverbed and marginal sandy sediments. These differences in gas fluxes resulted from either the submersion persistence or the alternation of submersion and emersion phases, which were ultimately due to the gap between elevation and river water variations. All this stresses the critical role of marginal aquatic habitats for river C budget.","Rossano Bolpagni;Laini, Alex;Mutti, Tiziana;Viaroli, Pierluigi;Bartoli, Marco",Scholarly Journals,2019,12,2162166182,proquest,RP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
immigration and early life stages recruitment of the european flounder platichthys flesus to an estuarine nursery the influence of environmental factors,"Connectivity between coastal spawning grounds and estuarine nurseries is a critical step in the life cycle of many fish species. Larval immigration and transport-associated physical–biological processes are determinants of recruitment success to nursery areas. The recruitment of the European flounder, Platichthys flesus, to estuarine nurseries located at the southern edge of the species distribution range, has been usually investigated during its juvenile stages, while estuarine recruitment during the earlier planktonic life stage remains largely unstudied. The present study investigated the patterns of flounder larval recruitment and the influence of environmental factors on the immigration of the early life stages to the Lima estuary (NW Portugal), integrating data on fish larvae and post-settlement individuals (&lt;50mm length), collected over 7years. Late-stage larvae arrived at the estuary between February and July and peak abundances were observed in April. Post-settlement individuals (&lt;50mm) occurred later between April and October, whereas newly-settled ones (&lt;20mm) were found only in May and June. Variables associated with the spawning, survival and growth of larvae in the ocean (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a and inland hydrological variables) were the major drivers of flounder occurrence in the estuarine nursery. Although the adjacent coastal area is characterized by a current system with strong seasonality and mesoscale variability, we did not identify any influence of variables related with physical processes (currents and upwelling) on the occurrence of early life stages in the estuary. A wider knowledge on the influence of the coastal circulation variability and its associated effects upon ocean-estuarine connectivity is required to improve our understanding of the population dynamics of marine spawning fish that use estuarine nurseries.","Amorim, Eva;Bordalo, Adriano A;Elliott, Michael;Ramos, Sandra",Scholarly Journals,2016,107,2000151948,proquest,RP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
hydrological connectivity as most probable key driver of chlorophyll and nutrients in oxbow lakes of the bug river poland ,"Concentrations of chlorophyll, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, total phosphorus and suspended solids were analysed in 10 oxbow lakes of the Bug River in spring and summer. According to their connectivity with the river, all lakes were divided into 3 categories – lakes connected with the river channel but separated from the floodplain inputs, lakes connected with the river but receiving inputs from the floodplain and totally isolated lakes. Connected lakes showed significantly higher concentrations of available nutrients and chlorophyll but the relationship between the two variables was weak in the spring and non-existent in the summer. Suspended solids were also more abundant in connected than in isolated lakes. Analyses of the proportion of chlorophyll and particulate phosphorus in suspension led us to the conclusion that water movement in connected lakes inhibited sedimentation and kept algae in the water column. Isolated oxbow lakes devoid of wind-driven mixing were more susceptible to algal sedimentation which would explain the differences observed between the two lake categories.","Kufel, Lech;Szymon Leśniczuk",Scholarly Journals,2014,46,2000146923,proquest,RP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
serial discontinuity along the descoberto river basin central brazil,"Aim: The Descoberto Basin was studied as a discontinuous ecological system through one seasonal cycle (about one year), at 13 sampling sites; Methods: The connectivity was analyzed in relation to environmental and limnological characteristics along the length of the Descoberto River, and the variables that most influenced the different sampling sites were determined; Results: Sites K and L, located upstream and downstream of the entrance of the Melchior River, respectively, differed most in physical and chemical parameters. A Principal Components Analysis demonstrated that the system was more influenced spatially than temporally, with 74.57% of accumulated variance accounted for by the first two axes. High values of chloride, chlorophyll-a, BOD5, total phosphorus, and total organic carbon, as well as low dissolved-oxygen concentrations separated sites L and M from the others. Winter and spring were the seasons in which most parameters showed significant differences among the sites; Conclusions: The construction of the dam and waste discharge act as discontinuity factors affecting the referred system, mainly at middle region and lower patch, between the sites K and L. Besides the construction of the reservoir, the Melchior River, an extremely impacted system, affects the Descoberto River downstream from its entry. Important changes in water quality occur in the lower basin, especially downstream of the Descoberto Reservoir, with significant increases in nutrient concentrations, suspended solids, turbidity, and chlorophyll a, and therefore a decrease in water clarity.Original Abstract: Objetivo: A bacia do rio Descoberto foi estudada como um sistema descontinuo atraves de um ciclo sazonal (um ano) em 13 estacoes amostrais; Metodos: A conectividade foi analisada em relacao a caracteristicas ambientais e limnologicas ao longo eixo longitudinal do rio Descoberto e as variaveis que mais influenciaram as diferentes estacoes amostrais foram determinadas; Resultados: As estacoes K e L, localizadas a montante e jusante da entrada do rio Melchior, respectivamente, diferiram mais quanto aos parametros fisicos e qulmicos da agua. Uma analise de componentes principals (PCA) demonstrou que o sistema foi mais influenciado espacialmente que temporalmente, com 74,57% da variancia total acumulada nos dois primeiros eixos. Altos valores de cloreto, clorofila a, DBO5, fosforo total e carbono organico total, tanto quanto baixas concentracoes de oxigenio dissolvido separaram as estacoes L e M das demais. Inverno e primavera foram estacoes nas quais a maioria dos parametros apresentou diferencas significativas entre as estacoes; Conclusoes: A construcao do reservatorio e descargas de esgoto atuaram como fatores de descontinuidade afetando o referido sistema, principalmente no trecho medio do rio e no trecho inferior, entre estacoes K e L. O rio Melchior, a partir de sua entrada, afetou o rio Descoberto. Importantes mudancas na qualidade de agua ocorreram na bacia especialmente a jusante do reservatorio, com aumentos significativos de nutrientes, solidos suspensos, turbidez e clorofila a e, portanto, na diminuicao da transparencia da agua.","da Silva, WJ;Felisberto, SA;Fonseca, C P;das Gracas Machado de Souza, M",Scholarly Journals,2010,22,869576543,proquest,RP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
floods increase similarity among aquatic habitats in river floodplain systems,"During low water levels, habitats in river-floodplain systems are isolated from each other and from the main river. Oppositely, floods tend to connect water bodies with distinct hydrological characteristics and, as a result, ecological processes and biological communities tend to be more similar among the distinct habitats that comprise a river-floodplain system. Based on a literature review and also using unpublished data obtained in tropical floodplains, the aim of this paper is to highlight the effects of floods as a process that reduce spatial variability. The usual negative relationship between the coefficient of variation of any ecological indicator (e.g., chlorophyll-a or total phosphorus) and water level is the main result demonstrating a reduction in spatial variability due to floods. Considering physical, chemical or biotic data gathered in distinct habitats within the floodplain, this pattern was found in temperate and tropical regions, subjected to distinct levels of anthropogenic impacts, and at different spatial extents. The main mechanism that accounts for this pattern may be stated as follow. During low water level, the biological communities of each habitat in the floodplain (e.g. lagoons, backwater, streams) follow distinct temporal trajectories due to the effects of local driving forces (e.g. an efficient predator trapped in a lagoon but not in another). Management plans and biodiversity conservation in river floodplain systems will benefit by considering the effects of flood homogenization and increased connectivity peculiar to these unique ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","Thomaz, Sidinei M;Bini, Luis Mauricio;Bozelli, Reinaldo Luiz",Scholarly Journals,2007,579,821237454,proquest,RP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
hydrologic variability water chemistry and phytoplankton biomass in a large floodplain of the sacramento river ca u s a ,"The Yolo Bypass, a large, managed floodplain that discharges to the headwaters of the San Francisco Estuary, was studied before, during, and after a single, month-long inundation by the Sacramento River in winter and spring 2000. The primary objective was to identify hydrologic conditions and other factors that enhance production of phytoplankton biomass in the floodplain waters. Recent reductions in phytoplankton have limited secondary production in the river and estuary, and increased phytoplankton biomass is a restoration objective for this system. Chlorophyll a was used as a measure of phytoplankton biomass in this study. Chlorophyll a concentrations were low (<4 mug l-1) during inundation by the river when flow through the floodplain was high, but concentrations rapidly increased as river inflow decreased and the floodplain drained. Therefore, hydrologic conditions in the weeks following inundation by river inflow appeared most important for producing phytoplankton biomass in the floodplain. Discharges from local streams were important sources of water to the floodplain before and after inundation by the river, and they supplied dissolved inorganic nutrients while chlorophyll a was increasing. Discharge from the floodplain was enriched in chlorophyll a relative to downstream locations in the river and estuary during the initial draining and later when local stream inflows produced brief discharge pulses. Based on the observation that phytoplankton biomass peaks during drainage events, we suggest that phytoplankton production in the floodplain and biomass transport to downstream locations would be higher in years with multiple inundation and draining sequences.","Schemel, Laurence Edward; Sommer, Ted R.; Muller-Solger, Anke B.; Harrell, William C.",Scholarly Journals,2004,513,BIOSIS:PREV200400273679,wos,RP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

fish assemblages of tropical floodplain lagoons exploring the role of connectivity in a dry year,"Irregular rainfall and pronounced reductions of the hydrometric level in the year 2000 resulted in drastically altered hydrological connectivity of lentic environments in the upper Parana River floodplain. The objective of the present work was to examine spatial and temporal patterns of fish assemblage attributes and structure in relation to limnological variables associated with hydrological connectivity. Fish were collected quarterly by seining in the marginal areas of 15 lagoons belonging to two biotopic categories (connected and disconnected). Variation, in assemblage composition reflected the degree of hydrological connectivity. Values of assemblage attributes (species richness, density and biomass) were significantly lower in connected lagoons than in disconnected lagoons. Significantly higher values of species richness and biomass were recorded in November than in August. Rare species had the greatest effect on observed patterns in fish assemblage ordination (DCA). Observed patterns of variation in assemblage attributes were directly correlated with factors related to hydrological connectivity, such as depth, resources (zooplankton and chlorophyll a) and nutrients (total phosphorus).","Petry, Ana Cristina; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio; Gomes, Luiz Carlos",Scholarly Journals,2003,1,BIOSIS:PREV200510180551,wos,RP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
lateral mobility of the light harvesting complex in chloroplast membranes controls excitation energy distribution in higher plants,"Chloroplast [pea] thylakoid protein phosphorylation produces changes in light-harvesting properties and in membrane structure as revealed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Protein phosphorylation resulted in an increase in the 77.degree. K fluorescence signal at 735 nm relative to that at 685 nm. In addition, a decrease in connectivity between Photosystem II centers (PS II) and a dynamic quenching of the room temperature variable fluorescence was observed upon phosphorylation. Accompanying these fluorescence changes was a 23% decrease in the amount of stacked membranes. Microscopic analyses indicated that 8.0-nm particles fracturing on the P-face moved from the stacked into the unstacked regions upon phosphorylation. The movement of the 8.0-nm particles was accompanied by the appearance of chlorophyll b and 25 to 29 kD [kiloDalton] polypeptides in isolated stroma lamellae fractions. Phosphorylation of a population of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein complexes (LHC) in grana partitions causes the migration of these pigment proteins from the PS II-rich appressed membranes into the Photosystem I (PS I) enriched unstacked regions. This increases the absorptive cross section of PS I. In addition, we suggest that the mobile population of LHC functions to interconnect PS II centers in grana partitions; removal of this population of LHC upon phosphorylation limits PS II .fwdarw.

the spatial ecology of phytoplankton blooms in uk canals,"Environmental change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of problems caused by harmful algal blooms. We investigated the ecology of phytoplankton blooms in UK canals to determine the environmental predictors and spatial structure of bloom communities. The results revealed a significant increase in bloom presence with increasing elevation. As predicted, higher temperatures were associated with a greater probability of blooms, but the relationship between temperature and bloom occurrence changed across landscapes. At the minimum level of agricultural land, the probability of bloom presence increased with increasing temperature. Conversely, at the maximum level, the probability decreased with increasing temperature. This pattern could be due to higher temperatures increasing phytoplankton growth rates despite lower nutrient concentrations at low levels of agricultural land, and nutrient depletion by rapidly growing blooms at high levels of agricultural land and temperatures. Community composition exhibited spatial autocorrelation; nearby blooms were more similar than distant blooms. Hydrological distances through the canal network showed a stronger association with community dissimilarity than Euclidean distances, suggesting a role for hydrological connectivity in driving bloom formation and composition. This new knowledge regarding canal phytoplankton bloom origin and ecology could help inform measures to inhibit bloom formation.","Kelly, Leah A.; Hassall, Christopher",Scholarly Journals,2018,8,BIOSIS:PREV201900249102,wos,RP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
influence of hydrological connectivity on winter limnology in floodplain lakes of the saskatchewan river delta saskatchewan,"Globally, hydrological connectivity between rivers and their floodplains has been reduced by river flow management and land transformation. The Saskatchewan River Delta is North America's largest inland delta and a hub for fish and fur production. To determine the influence of connectivity on limnology within this northern floodplain, water chemistry and stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) were analyzed during the winter of 2014 in 26 shallow lakes along a hydrological gradient. A total of five lake connectivity categories were determined by optical remote sensing imagary of surface water coverage area from years of varying flood intensities. Accuracy of categories was verified by degree of O-18 and H-2 enrichment within lakes. Both isotopes showed marked successional enrichment between connectivity categories, with more isolated lakes exhibiting greater enrichment. Water chemistry in lakes with greater connectivity to the main channel were characterized by higher pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and sulfates and lower total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and ammonium compared with more isolated lakes. These findings illustrate how connectivity influences water chemistry in northern floodplain lakes and how it might determine the suitability of these lakes as winter refuge for fishes. Additionally, our study provides supporting evidence for the effective use of optical remote sensing imagery, an inexpensive and accessible source of data for researchers, when determining connectivity characteristics of large northern floodplain systems. Additionally, this study provides further evidence that the inundation of floodplain lakes by river water during peak discharge has an impact on the conditions within the lakes long into the winter ice-cover season. Understanding the year-round influence of river-floodplain connection is imperative for assessing potential impacts of climate change and future water regulation on such ecosystems.","MacKinnon, Brett D.; Sagin, Jay; Baulch, Helen M.; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich; Jardine, Timothy D.",Scholarly Journals,2016,73,BIOSIS:PREV201600234351,wos,RP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
