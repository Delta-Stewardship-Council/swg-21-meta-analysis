temporal coherence between lake and landscape primary productivity,"Understanding the patterns and drivers of primary productivity is a major goal of ecology, but little is known about whether the primary productivities of different types of ecosystems—here, lakes and the landscapes in which they are embedded—fluctuate in related ways through time. Due to shared climatic variation and well-known connections between lake and terrestrial ecosystems, such as nutrient and resource subsidies, we hypothesized that interannual fluctuations in aquatic and terrestrial primary productivity indices could be coherent. We also expected that lake and watershed characteristics could modify the strength and nature of primary productivity relationships. We applied wavelet coherence analyses to time series of lake chlorophyll-a and satellite-derived NDVI to examine coherence between lakes and land, and used random forest regression and generalized additive models to evaluate why coherence varies among lakes. There can be substantial coherence between lake and terrestrial primary productivity, but the strength and phase (direction and time lag) of this relationship vary widely, and there were marked differences between short (2–4-year periods of oscillation) and long (&gt; 4-year periods of oscillation) timescales. Across all timescales, variables associated with the connectedness of lakes to their watersheds were consistently the important explanatory variables of the strength and phase of coherence. The patterns observed in this study suggest the importance of cross-ecosystem flows, as opposed to shared climatic variation, in determining temporal coherence between lakes and the landscape.","Walter, Jonathan A;Fleck, Rachel;Kastens, Jude H;Pace, Michael L;Wilkinson, Grace M",Scholarly Journals,2021,24,2517102093,proquest,DC,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
suspended sediment nutrients and chlorophyll in tropical floodplain lakes with different patterns of hydrological connectivity,"The ecological functioning of floodplain lakes is largely influenced by the interaction with the river mainstem. In this study, seasonal variation in water chemistry and the relationship with the river conditions were compared between floodplain lakes that differ in the level of connection to the Usumacinta River, the largest river of Mesoamerica. Samples for suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll a were collected through the year in lakes permanently connected to the river and in lakes that only received water from the Usumacinta for a short period during peak flow. Floodplain lakes showed higher total suspended solids than the river during the dry season while during the rainy season greater differences were observed between the river and the lakes, probably explained by higher concentrations in the river and greater sedimentation in the lakes. Greater organic matter content in the suspended solids was observed in the floodplain lakes, particularly in the more isolated lakes, likely related to high algal biomass. Nitrate concentrations were always higher in the river than in the lakes and lower nitrate concentrations occurred at the isolated lakes, suggesting that processes that remove nitrate occur through the year and are a common feature of floodplain lakes. Phosphorus in the connected lakes was higher than in the river only during the dry season, while in the isolated lakes concentrations were always greater than in the river. Chlorophyll a concentrations were higher in the connected lakes than in the river only during the dry season, while the more isolated lakes exhibited higher values through the year, showing signs of eutrophication. Suspended organic matter, nitrate, and chlorophyll showed larger differences between lake and river sites in the more isolated lakes, probably related to greater water residence time and its influence on primary production. Less connected lakes are more vulnerable to flow alteration because the brief period of connection to the river can be compromised and the effects of eutrophication exacerbated.","Castillo, María M",Scholarly Journals,2020,82,2439434677,proquest,DC,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
biological responses to recent eutrophication and hydrologic changes in xingyun lake southwest china,"The synergistic influence of multiple environmental stressors on lake ecosystems has typically been evaluated paleolimnologically, through examination of a single biological indicator. Aquatic organisms, however, may display heterogeneous responses because of differences in their ecological sensitivity, and/or because of ecological consequences caused by strong interactions among multiple stressors. We applied paleolimnological methods to compare patterns of algal and invertebrate response to multiple stressors in a large, shallow lake in southwest China over the last two centuries. Our multi-proxy records show a clear trajectory of lake eutrophication (greater total nitrogen) and increasing lake productivity (greater sediment Chlorophyll-a concentration) during the last century. Nutrient enrichment and lake productivity played significant, but different roles, in structuring diatom and cladoceran assemblages, accounting for 31.4 and 77.3% of the total variance in the communities, respectively. Furthermore, there was a pronounced influx of the endemic diatom species Cyclotella rhomboideo-elliptica Skuja, which was strongly associated with the second axis of a diatom PCA (Principal Component Analysis). This occurred synchronously with a documented reversal of hydrological connectivity with a downstream, nutrient-poor lake during the early twentieth century, suggesting a role for species dispersal in modulating community reorganization. There are also strong differences between the two organism groups in their sensitivity to hydrological fluctuations, as hydrodynamics, indicated by sand content, was a significant driver for cladocerans (>25%), but showed only minor influence on diatom assemblages in our selection of minimum adequate models. The proportion of the total variance explained by our measured variables (<30%) was much lower for diatom assemblages than for both cladoceran assemblage and accumulation data ( approximately 77%), reflecting differences in community reorganization between the two biological indicators. The sediment-based evaluation of community responses revealed the differential impact of eutrophication and hydrological fluctuations on the biota of this large, shallow lake. Therefore, multiple biological indicators should be evaluated in limnological surveys to assess the full scope of ecological changes in highly stressed lake systems targeted for conservation or restoration.

hydrological pulse regulating the bacterial heterotrophic metabolism between amazonian mainstems and floodplain lakes ,"We evaluated in situ rates of bacterial carbon processing in Amazonian floodplain lakes and mainstems, during both high water (HW) and low water (LW) phases (p &lt; 0.05). Our results showed that bacterial production (BP) was lower and more variable than bacterial respiration, determined as total respiration. Bacterial carbon demand was mostly accounted by BR and presented the same pattern that BR in both water phases. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) showed a wide range (0.2-23%) and low mean value of 3 and 6%, (in HW and LW, respectively) suggesting that dissolved organic carbon was mostly allocated to catabolic metabolism. However, BGE was regulated by BP in LW phase. Consequently, changes in BGE showed the same pattern that BP. In addition, the hydrological pulse effects on mainstems and floodplains lakes connectivity were found for BP and BGE in LW. Multiple correlation analyses revealed that indexes of organic matter (OM) quality (chlorophyll-a, N stable isotopes and C/N ratios) were the strongest seasonal drivers of bacterial carbon metabolism. Our work indicated that: (i) the bacterial metabolism was mostly driven by respiration in Amazonian aquatic ecosystems resulting in low BGE in either high or LW phase; (ii) the hydrological pulse regulated the bacterial heterotrophic metabolism between Amazonian mainstems and floodplain lakes mostly driven by OM quality.","Vidal, Luciana O;Abril, Gwenäel;Artigas, Luiz F;Melo, Michaela L;Bernardes, Marcelo C;Lobão, Lúcia M;Reis, Mariana C;Moreira-Turcq, Patrícia;Benedetti, Marc;Tornisielo, Valdemar L;Roland, Fabio",Scholarly Journals,2015,6,1725025157,proquest,DC,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
abundance and biomass responses of microbial food web components to hydrology and environmental gradients within a floodplain of the river danube,"This study investigated the relationships of time-dependent hydrological variability and selected microbial food web components. Samples were collected monthly from the Kopački Rit floodplain in Croatia, over a period of 19 months, for analysis of bacterioplankton abundance, cell size and biomass; abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and nanophytoplankton; and concentration of chlorophyll a. Similar hydrological variability at different times of the year enabled partition of seasonal effects from hydrological changes on microbial community properties. The results suggested that, unlike some other studies investigating sites with different connectivity, bacterioplankton abundance, and phytoplankton abundance and biomass increased during lentic conditions. At increasing water level, nanophytoplankton showed lower sensitivity to disturbance in comparison with total phytoplankton biomass: this could prolong autotrophic conditions within the floodplain. Bacterioplankton biomass, unlike phytoplankton, was not impacted by hydrology. The bacterial biomass less affected by hydrological changes can be an important additional food component for the floodplain food web. The results also suggested a mechanism controlling bacterial cell size independent of hydrology, as bacterial cell size was significantly decreased as nanoflagellate abundance increased. Hydrology, regardless of seasonal sucession, has the potential to structure microbial food webs, supporting microbial development during lentic conditions. Conversely, other components appear unaffected by hydrology or may be more strongly controlled by biotic interactions. This research, therefore, adds to understanding on microbial food web interactions in the context of flood and flow pulses in river-floodplain ecosystems.","Palijan, Goran",Scholarly Journals,2012,64,1400127912,proquest,DC,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
spatial variability of zooplankton along a section of river sio under different habitat conditions,"Many factors influence the abundance and species richness of zooplankton in river systems, including river hydrology, morphology, phytoplankton development and biotic interactions. River Sio discharges into Lake Victoria and forms a boundary between Kenya and Uganda at its middle and lower reaches. The river has an average discharge of 11.4 m3s-1 contributing 1.5% of riverine water input into Lake Victoria. Zooplankton community studies were carried out along a section of River Sio and its floodplain on the Ugandan side between November 2008 and January 2009. The main focus of the study was that River Sio zooplankton diversity; biomass and abundance patterns were expected to change with differing levels of lateral connectivity and habitat heterogeneity of the river plus its floodplain. Sampling along lateral and longitudinal transects of the river were done to investigate the effect of habitat heterogeneity subject to the river's flooding regimes on the abundance, composition and diversity of its zooplankton. Zooplankton samples were collected using a zooplankton net of mesh size 60/lm and a Schindler trap sampler for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Other factors determined were selected physico-chemical variables. Zooplankton and physical-chemical data were subjected to statistical analyses (ANOVA, multivariate, regression and correlation analyses) for significant tests after log transformation. The ordination of samples (sites and dates) of physical-chemical or biological variables was carried out using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Similarity and diversity indices were used to assess structural patterns. In total, 45 rotifer, 9 copepod and 7 cladocera species were identified. Mean zooplankton density and biomass of River Sio were lower in the main channel of the river compared to its floodplain sites. Significant habitat differences were observed for zooplankton composition and abundance but no seasonal biomass and density differences were identified. Nutrient levels of River Sio were found to be very low. Physicalchemical factors like chlorophyll-a showed strong influences on the zooplankton community structure. These findings suggest that both low and high river water levels and the availability of heterogeneous habitats are crucial for zooplankton development in River Sio. The high zooplankton density observed bears significance to the ecological functions of the river as a breeding and nursery ground for potamodromous fishes from Lake Victoria.","Gimbo, R",Books,2009,NA,968183622,proquest,DC,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
hydrological connectivity and the exchange of organic matter and nutrients in a dynamic river floodplain system danube austria ,"1. The relationship between hydrological connectivity, and the exchange processes of suspended sediments, organic matter and nutrients (NO sub(3)-N) was investigated in a dynamically connected river-floodplain segment of the Danube over a 15-month period in 1995 and 1996 in the Alluvial Zone National Park, Austria. 2. Based on water level dynamics and water retention times, three phases of river-floodplain connectivity were identified: disconnection (phase I), seepage inflow (phase II) and upstream surface connection (phase III). The frequency of occurrence of these phases was 67.5%, 29.3% and 3.2%, respectively, during the study period. 3. A conceptual model is presented linking hydrological connectivity with ecological processes. Generally, the floodplain shifts from a closed and mainly biologically controlled ecosystem during phase I to an increasingly open and more hydrologically controlled system during phases II and III. Phase I, with internal processes dominating, is designated the 'biotic interaction phase'. 4. Phase II, with massive nutrient inputs to the floodplain yet relatively high residence times, and therefore, high algal biomass, is classified as the 'primary production phase'. This demonstrates that water level fluctuations well below bankfull may considerably enhance floodplain productivity. 5. Finally, since transport of particulate matter is mainly restricted to short flood pulses above bankfull level, phase III has been defined as the 'transport phase'. 6. The floodplain served as a major sink for suspended sediments (250 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)), FPOM (96 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)), particulate organic carbon (POC; 2.9 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)) and nitrate-nitrogen (0.96 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)), but was a source for dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 240 kg ha super(-1) year super(-1)), algal biomass (chlorophyll-a; 0.5 kg ha super(-1) year super(-1)) and CPOM (21 kg ha super(-1) year super(-1)). Considerable quantities of DOC and algal biomass were exported to the river channel during phase II, whereas particulate matter transport was largely restricted to the short floods of phase III. 7. The Danube Restoration Project will create a more gradual change between the individual phases by increasing hydrological connectivity between the river channel and the floodplain, and is predicted to enhance productivity by maintaining a balance between retention and export of nutrients and organic matter.","Tockner, K;Pennetzdorfer, D;Reiner, N;Schiemer, F;Ward, J V",Scholarly Journals,1999,41,17380345,proquest,DC,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

microcrustacean cladocera copepoda ostracoda diversity in three side arms in the gemenc floodplain danube river hungary in different hydrological situations,"The microcrustacean assemblages, from different functional units of the Gemenc Floodplain (Danube River), were studied in various hydrological situations between 2002 and 2009. Sixty-three microcrustacean taxa were recorded from which 38 belonged to Cladocera, 18 to Copepoda and seven to Ostracoda. Among them there were some rare for the Middle Danube Region species, such as Dunhevedia crassa King, 1853, Holopedium gibberum Zaddach, 1855, Monospilus dispar (Sars, 1862). Significant differences were found between the different functional units of the floodplain focusing on the examined parameters of the microcrustacean assemblages. The most important factors influencing the species richness, as well as the density and diversity patterns of the assemblages, were the occurrence of flow, the connectivity with the main arm and the hydrological distance from the main arm. Most of these environmental factors are determined by the water level fluctuations of the Danube River which showed a negative correlation with all the examined parameters of the zooplankton assemblages. The density of the communities in both side arms correlated positively with the chlorophyll-a concentration. Moreover, the microcrustacean abundance showed an inverse relationship with the temperature but not in all of the side arms.","Kiss, Anita; Agoston-Szabo, Edit; Dinka, Maria; Schoell, Karoly; Berczik, Arpad",Scholarly Journals,2014,NA,BIOSIS:PREV201400560928,wos,DC,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
aquatic metabolism short term response to the flood pulse in a mediterranean floodplain,"The pulsing of river discharge affects biodiversity and productivity of whole river-floodplain ecosystems, triggering the transport, storage and processing of carbon. In this study we investigate the short-term changes in water chemistry and net pelagic metabolism (NEP) in two floodplain lakes in response to a flood pulse. The two oxbow lakes investigated in the floodplain of the Mediterranean Ebro River (NE Spain) showed a clear temporal shift in their metabolic balance, controlled by the river discharge and associated changes in water physical and chemical characteristics. Water chemistry (turbidity, water organic matter, chlorophyll a and nutrients concentration) returned to pre-flood values after 4 days, highlighting the resilience of the ecosystem to flood pulses. Lake NEP was depressed before and during floods to a minimum of -34 mg O-2 m(-3) h(-1), and increased after the flood pulse to a maximum of +463 mg O-2 m(-3) h(-1). The phytoplankton assemblage showed before and after floods a replacement of autotrophic species (e.g. Chlorophyceans) by mixotrophic organisms (e.g. Cryptophyceans, Euglenoids). A linear mixed effects model identified abiotic factors, particularly temperature and river discharge, as significant predictors of the net aquatic metabolism and community respiration during flood conditions. Our results suggest that the role of the Ebro floodplain lakes as sources or sinks of C is complex and relative to the time scale investigated, depending strongly on the river discharge dynamics and the transport of limiting nutrients (phosphorus).","Gallardo, B.; Espanol, C.; Comin, F.

spatial distribution of nutrient limitation in the danube river floodplain in relation to hydrological connectivity,"In this paper, we describe the influence of flooding on nutrient conditions and phytoplankton Chl-a concentrations in a hydrologically dynamic Danube floodplain in North-Eastern Croatia. Based on hydrological typology, the connectivity gradient extends from the main river stream (Eupotamal) to the backwater channels and side-arms (Parapotamal) to the edge of the floodplain (Paleopotamal). A spatial gradient of phytoplankton Chl-a occurred during low water levels, while uniformity of Chl-a across wetland habitats was observed during high water levels. Nutrient enrichment assays indicated that inorganic nutrients in Eupotamal waters (N/P ratio 16-22) could support a higher growth rate of the assay alga Chlorella kessleri, while potential N limitation was found in Parapotamal and Paleopotamal waters (both with N/P ratios< 14). Spatial expansion of N limitation toward the main river was observed as inundation continued. Lateral flood pulse connectivity along with the duration of inundation period affects the input and the retention of nutrients, especially of nitrogen. Understanding of the relationship between spatial (location of the floodplain waterbodies regarding the river) and temporal (hydrological connectivity between the river and its floodplain) dimensions contribute to the importance of healthy floodplains for the maintenance of water quality and environmental conditions in the Danube River.","Persic, Vesna; Horvatic, Janja",Scholarly Journals,2011,31,BIOSIS:PREV201100752041,wos,DC,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
spatial connectivity in a large river system resolving the sources and fate of dissolved organic matter,"Large rivers are generally heterogeneous and productive systems that receive important inputs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial and in situ sources. Thus, they are likely to play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of the DOM flowing to the oceans. The asymmetric spatial gradient driven by directional flow and environmental heterogeneity contributes to the fate of DOM flowing downstream. Yet, the relative effects of spatial connectivity and environmental heterogeneity on DOM dynamics are poorly understood. For example, since environmental variables show spatial heterogeneity, the variation explained by environmental and spatial variables may be redundant. We used the St. Lawrence River (SLR) as a representative large river to resolve the unique influences of environmental heterogeneity and spatial connectivity on DOM dynamics. We used three-dimensional fluorescence matrices combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to characterize the DOM pool in the SLR. Seven fluorophores were modeled, of which two were identified to be of terrestrial origin and three from algal exudates. We measured a set of environmental variables that are known to drive the fate of DOM in aquatic systems. Additionally, we used asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM) modeling to take spatial connectivity into account. The combination of spatial and environmental models explained 85% of the DOM variation. We show that spatial connectivity is an important driver of DOM dynamics, as a large fraction of environmental heterogeneity was attributable to the asymmetric spatial gradient. Along the longitudinal axis, we noted a rapid increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), mostly controlled by terrestrial input of DOM originating from the tributaries. Variance partitioning demonstrated that freshly produced protein-like DOM was found to be the preferential substrate for heterotrophic bacteria undergoing rapid proliferation, while humic-like DOM was more correlated to the diffuse attenuation coefficient of UVA radiation.","Massicotte, Philippe; Frenette, Jean-Jacques",Scholarly Journals,2011,21,BIOSIS:PREV201200002982,wos,DC,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
