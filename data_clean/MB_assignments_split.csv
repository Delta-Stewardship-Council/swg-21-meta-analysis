the performance of ecological cage aquaculture of pejerrey odontesthes bonariensis in pampean lakes under two different hydrological scenarios,"Ecological aquaculture promotes the development of sustainable farming systems, focusing on a wide range of ecosystem elements. The ecological aquaculture of the zooplanktivorous pejerrey ( Odontesthes bonariensis ) in floating cages in Pampean shallow lakes (Argentina) needs to be carried out considering the hydrological and chemical variations as modulators of plankton community and consequently of the pejerrey yield. To assess its performance in lakes with contrasting hydrological regimes, an experiment was carried out in two water bodies: La Salada de Monasterio Lake (Mon), an endorheic environment, and San Lorenzo Lake (Lor), connected to several lakes and the Salado River. During the experiment, regional rainfall generated high hydrological variability in Lor Lake changing its status of unconnected lake to a run‐of‐the‐river lake. High standard deviation in Chlorophyll‐a values in Lor indicated the significant effects of hydrological instability on the plankton community. Microcrustaceans abundance and biomass were higher in Mon, and almost disappeared in Lor when it turns into run‐of‐the‐river. The final fish growth and survival were significantly higher in Mon, endorsing the importance of zooplankton of high nutritional quality and hydrological, physical–chemical and biological stability. The results indicate that productive and stable environments with a sustained offer of natural food are better for the zooplanktivorous fish production. Connectivity with other water bodies and hydrological dependence on rainfall regimes have defining effects on phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish production, thus emerging as key factors to be considered for achieving better results in the ecological aquaculture implementation.","Javier R Garcia de Souza;Moreno, Vivian Yorojo;Sathicq, María B;Gómez, Nora;Sampietro, Susana;Donadelli, Jorge;Colautti, Darío C",Scholarly Journals,2021,52,2572363494,proquest,MB,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

shifts of environmental and phytoplankton variables in a regulated river a spatial driven analysis,"The longitudinal structure of the environmental and phytoplankton variables was investigated in the Ebro River (NE Spain), which is heavily affected by water abstraction and regulation. A first exploration indicated that the phytoplankton community did not resist the impact of reservoirs and barely recovered downstream of them. The spatial analysis showed that the responses of the phytoplankton and environmental variables were not uniform. The two set of variables revealed spatial variability discontinuities and river fragmentation upstream and downstream from the reservoirs. Reservoirs caused the replacement of spatially heterogeneous habitats by homogeneous spatially distributed water bodies, these new environmental conditions downstream benefiting the opportunist and cosmopolitan algal taxa. The application of a spatial auto-regression model to algal biomass (chlorophyll-a) permitted to capture the relevance and contribution of extra-local influences in the river ecosystem.","Sabater-Liesa, Laia;Ginebreda, Antoni;Barceló, Damià",Scholarly Journals,2018,642,2084071810,proquest,MB,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
abiotic variability among different aquatic systems of the central amazon floodplain during drought and flood events,"This paper examines water properties from lakes, channels and paleo-channels located in Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve, in Central Amazon floodplain, Amazonas, Brazil. The authors analysed surface temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, transparency, suspended inorganic and organic matter, chlorophyll-a, pheophytin, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, organic and inorganic carbon in 2009 high water phase, 2009 and 2010 low water phases. Multivariate statistical analyses of 24 aquatic systems (6 ressacas, 12 lakes and 6 channels, 142 samples) were applied to the variables. First, they analysed the entire set of variables to test for differences among phases of the hydrological year and types of aquatic systems using a PERMANOVA two-way crossed design. The results showed that the all measured limnological variables are distinct regarding both factors: types of aquatic systems and hydrological phases. In general, the magnitude and amplitude of all variables were higher in the low water phase than in the high water phase, except for water transparency in all aquatic system's types.","Affonso, A G;Queiroz, H L",Scholarly Journals,2015,75,1757013661,proquest,MB,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
hydrological connectivity and basin morphometry influence seasonal water chemistry variations in tundra ponds of the northwestern hudson bay lowlands,"Due to shallow depth and high surface area-to-volume ratio, ponds of the Hudson Bay Lowlands are vulnerable to climatic and hydrological changes, but relations between hydrological processes and limnological conditions remain unknown. Here, we measured water balance and limnological variables (water chemistry, suspended sediments, chlorophyll-a) at 20 ponds near Churchill (Manitoba) three times during the ice-free season of 2010 to explore relations among hydrological connectivity, basin morphometry, and water chemistry variations. Using principal components analysis, we identified that the ponds followed one of four distinctive ""seasonal water chemistry trajectories"" (SWCT1-4). Most of the ponds that lacked apparent hydrologic connectivity displayed SWCT1, characterized by rising alkalinity and ionic content between early June and late July due to evaporative concentration. In contrast, most ponds with apparent hydrological connectivity displayed SWCT2 or SWCT3, characterized by marked changes in suspended sediment and total nitrogen concentrations due to inflow that transferred allochthonous materials from the catchment. Ponds in SWCT2 likely possessed temporary hydrological connections during periods of relatively high water supply and exhibited marked decline of suspended sediment and total nitrogen content when hydrological connection was lost. Most ponds in SWCT3 maintained active hydrological connections during all or most of the ice-free season and possessed relatively high suspended sediment and total nitrogen concentrations throughout the season. Ponds in SWCT4 possessed relatively stable water chemistry due to greater water depth and local features that reduced wind-induced sediment resuspension. We conclude that hydrological connectivity and basin morphometry exert important influence on seasonal pond water-chemistry dynamics.","White, Jerry;Hall, Roland I;Wolfe, Brent B;Light, Erin M;Macrae, Merrin L;Fishback, LeeAnn;Keller, Wendel;Paterson, Andrew M;Ruehland, Kathleen M;Blais, Jules M",Scholarly Journals,2014,46,2367028852,proquest,MB,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
functional indicators of stream health a river basin approach,"Summary1. The efficacy of leaf-litter decomposition, sediment respiration, biofilm biomass, growth, chlorophyll a concentration and the autotrophic index (biofilm ash-free dry mass-chlorophyll a) and fungal biomass for detecting human-induced change was evaluated using 24 references and 15 disturbed stream sites located in central Portugal.2. Decomposition rates of alder (Alnus glutinosa) and oak (Quercus robur) leaves and sediment respiration rates were effective in discriminating impairment. Decomposition was negatively correlated with abiotic factors, such as ammonium and nitrite concentrations, connectivity and alterations in the hydrological regime, and positively correlated with nitrate concentration and oxygen concentration. Sediment respiration rates were correlated with organic contamination, land use and morphological changes.3. Growth rates of biofilm, concentration of chlorophyll a and the autotrophic index, although 41-73% higher at disturbed compared to reference sites, were not significantly different. These three variables were significantly correlated with total organic carbon, oxygen concentration, pH, nitrite and the presence of dams. Fungal biomass on leaves and biofilm biomass on natural substrata did not differ between reference and disturbed sites.4. Our findings lend support to the use of functional variables like decomposition and sediment respiration in monitoring and when used together with structural variables should give a more holistic measure of stream health.","FEIO, MJ;Alves, T;BOAVIDA, M;Medeiros, A;Graca, Mas",Scholarly Journals,2010,55,746081344,proquest,MB,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
hydrological seasonality and benthic algal biomass in a neotropical floodplain river,"Our study evaluated spatiotemporal variation of physicochemical parameters and benthic and sestonic algal biomass in littoral areas of the main channel and floodplain lakes of the Cinaruco River, a lowland tributary of the Orinoco River in Venezuela. The Cinaruco is characterized by a highly predictable annual flood pulse, high transparency, and extremely low conductivity and suspended sediment load. During 2002 and 2003, 10 sites in the main channel and floodplain lagoons were sampled on 12 occasions. Correspondence analysis based on water physicochemical variables and algal biomass showed that (similar to)80% of the variation in the multivariate space among sites and sampling dates was explained by 2 axes. During the high-water periods, river and lagoon sites showed high similarity in water variables and algal biomass. Conductivity, SiO 3 , and chlorophyll a concentrations (both benthic and sestonic) were low during the high-water phase. On the other hand, water variables and algal biomass differed between river and lagoon sites during the low-water period. The absence of flow in lagoons and consistently low algal biomass (sestonic and benthic) in river sites were the most important features of the spatial variability between main channel and lagoon sites during low-water phases. Benthic chlorophyll a was highly uniform at small spatial scales and significantly heterogeneous at large spatial scales. The annual flood regime of the Cinaruco, which drives the concentrations of dissolved materials and affects material interchanges between aquatic and terrestrial systems, also appears to be responsible for creating strong patterns of seasonal and spatial variation in benthic algal crops.

contrasts between channels and backwaters in a large floodplain river testing our understanding of nutrient cycling phytoplankton abundance and suspended solids dynamics,"In floodplain rivers, variability in hydraulic connectivity interacts with biogeochemistry to determine the distribution of suspended and dissolved substances. Nutrient, chlorophyll a, and suspended solids data spanning longitudinal (5 study reaches across 1300 river km), lateral (main channel and backwaters), and temporal (1994-2011) gradients in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) were used to examine the extent to which observed differences between the main channel and backwaters were consistent with expectations based on current understanding of biogeochemical processes in large rivers. For N and P, the results largely conformed to expectations. N concentrations were greater in the main channel than in the backwaters in 82 to 96% of the observations across river reaches. Maximum TP concentrations generally occurred in backwaters during summer, when backwater TP often exceeded that of the main channel. Flux of P from sediments may be a substantial source of water-column P in UMR backwaters in summer. The data for suspended solids and chlorophyll a suggest that some refinements are needed of our understanding of ecosystem processes in large rivers. During low-discharge conditions, concentrations of inorganic suspended solids often were greater in backwaters than in the main channel, suggesting the importance of sediment resuspension. Chlorophyll a concentrations were usually greater in backwaters than in the main channel, but exceptions indicate that phytoplankton abundance in the main channel of the UMR can sometimes be greater than is typically expected for large rivers.","Houser, Jeffrey N.",Scholarly Journals,2016,35,BIOSIS:PREV201600572060,wos,MB,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
intra annual variation of chlorophyll a and nutrients in a hydraulically perturbed river floodplain system in the grijalva river basin,"Background: The lateral connectivity in the Maluco river-floodplain system was partially reduced by the highway built on a natural barrier. Goal: To determine if the concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and nutrients contrast in different water levels (WL) during a hydrologic year in the Maluco river-floodplain system. Methods: The WL, Chl-a, and nutrients (NO2-, NO3-, NH(4)(+)and TP) were simultaneously measured six times in two sites during two years. The expected differences of Chl-a and nutrients concentrations, related to the intra-annual fluctuation of the WL, were tested through multivariate techniques. The hypothesis holds that there will be no intra-annual differences of Chl-a and nutrients due to the reduction of lateral interconnection by the physical effect of the embankment. Results: No variable was discarded during PCA. The intra-annual distribution of samples was similar according to the similarity profile routine. Furthermore: 1) more than 54% of the Chl-a and TP values indicated hypereutrophic conditions throughout the year, and 2) none of the values of WL surpassed the height of the bankfull (4.5 mast). The maximum concentrations of Chl-a were registered at the minimum WL values. Conclusions: The intra-annual similarity of Chl-a and inorganic nutrients can be linked to the disconnection between the floodplain and the Grijalva river since the bankfull was not overflowed throughout the sampling time. The intra-annual trend independent at the time of persistence of the high Chl-a and TP concentrations ill the river-floodplain system opens up the opportunity to estimate the minimum input flow required to biogeochemical processes in a long-term study.","Cruz-Ramirez, Allan K.; Angel Salcedo, Miguel; Sanchez, Alberto J.; de Dios Mendoza, Juan; Barba, Everardo; Alvarez-Pliego, Nicolas; Florido, Rosa",Scholarly Journals,2019,29,BIOSIS:PREV202100568878,wos,MB,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
influence of hydrological heterogeneity on rotifer community structure in three different water bodies in shantou area guangdong china ,"Rotifers, small but essential invertebrates in aquatic ecosystems, are sensitive to environmental changes and are proposed to be indicators of trophic state. However, the effects of hydrological heterogeneity on the rotifer community and the ability of rotifer indices to reflect trophic state across different water bodies are still unclear. Here, we investigated rotifer community structure in different seasons in the three types of water bodies: Han river downstream (HD), Reservoir (RE) and Tidal creek (TC) in Shantou City, Guangdong, China. Our findings revealed that rotifer community structure differes significantly among the three water bodies, resulting from a dominance of Keratella cochlearis, Anuraeopsis fissa and Polyarthra vulgaris, who largely accounted for the differences in water bodies. Chlorophyll-a and transparency were the main environmental drivers in RE rotifer communities, while total nitrogen, total phosphorus and salinity were the main factors in HD and TC communities. Rotifer abundance and the rotifer trophic state index decreased in the order: RE > HD > TC. However, both the Sladecek's B/T quotient and the Keratella-index decreased in the order: HD > RE > TC, which was in accordance with the Carlson's trophic index. We conclude that it is efficient to use rotifer composition in water quality assessments when comparing different water bodies. Alpha diversity of rotifers was the highest in HD, which is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Hydrological heterogeneity is the micro-factor that regulates rotifer community structures in the Shantou area.","Liang, Diwen; Wei, Nan; Wang, Qing; Jersabek, Christian D.; He, Xuejia; Yang, Yufeng",Scholarly Journals,2019,58,BIOSIS:PREV201900931662,wos,MB,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
hydrological pulse regulating the bacterial heterotrophic metabolism between amazonian mainstems and floodplain lakes,"We evaluated in situ rates of bacterial carbon processing in Amazonian floodplain lakes and mainstems, during both high water (HW) and low water (LW) phases (p < 0.05). Our results showed that bacterial production (BP) was lower and more variable than bacterial respiration, determined as total respiration. Bacterial carbon demand was mostly accounted by BR and presented the same pattern that BR in both water phases. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) showed a wide range (0.2 -23%) and low mean value of 3 and 6%, (in HW and LW, respectively) suggesting that dissolved organic carbon was mostly allocated to catabolic metabolism. However, BGE was regulated by BP in LW phase. Consequently, changes in BGE showed the same pattern that BP. In addition, the hydrological pulse effects on mainstems and floodplains lakes connectivity were found for BP and BGE in LW. Multiple correlation analyses revealed that indexes of organic matter (OM) quality (chlorophyll-a, N stable isotopes and C/N ratios) were the strongest seasonal drivers of bacterial carbon metabolism. Our work indicated that: (i) the bacterial metabolism was mostly driven by respiration in Amazonian aquatic ecosystems resulting in low BGE in either high or LW phase; (ii) the hydrological pulse regulated the bacterial heterotrophic metabolism between Amazonian mainstems and floodplain lakes mostly driven by OM quality.","Vidal, Luciana O.; Abril, Gwenael; Artigas, Luiz F.; Melo, Michaela L.; Bernardes, Marcelo C.; Lobao, Lucia M.; Reis, Mariana C.; Moreira-Turcq, Patricia; Benedetti, Marc; Tornisielo, Valdemar L.; Roland, Fabio",Scholarly Journals,2015,6,BIOSIS:PREV201500808592,wos,MB,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
land sea connectivity ecohydrology and holistic management of the great barrier reef and its catchments time for a change,"The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is an iconic and highly valued ecosystem in Queensland, Australia that is recognised internationally for its natural and cultural values. The coastal and marine ecosystems of the GBR are interconnected with the adjacent catchment area through hydrological connections. However, many GBR ecosystems are in a poor state, driven by several factors including a highly modified catchment. Land use changes over the last 160 years have led to development of agricultural land uses, modification of the coastal floodplains and loss of freshwater wetlands, and disruption of drainage and hydrological connections. These ecohydrological changes have led to declining water quality in catchment waterways and increases in the loads of pollutants that are delivered to the GBR, which predominantly occurs in wet season rainfall events. The Australian and State governments have recognised the need to address water quality issues for the GBR through management of the catchments, however, the management strategies adopted to date are largely associated with improvement of agricultural management practices and are not likely to be enough to maintain or restore the health of the GBR ecosystems. Future management strategies need to take into the account the need to protect, maintain and restore coastal ecosystems, system functions and land-sea connectivity if the values of the GBR are to be retained in the long term.

a multidisciplinary approach to investigate deep pelagic ecosystem dynamics in the gulf of mexico following deepwater horizon,"The pelagic Gulf of Mexico (GoM) is a complex system of dynamic physical oceanography (western boundary current, mesoscale eddies), high biological diversity, and community integration via diel vertical migration and lateral advection. Humans also heavily utilize this system, including its deep-sea components, for resource extraction, shipping, tourism, and other commercial activity. This utilization has had impacts, some with disastrous consequences. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DWHOS) occurred at a depth of similar to 1500 m (Macondo wellhead), creating a persistent and toxic mixture of hydrocarbons and dispersant in the deep-pelagic (water column below 200 m depth) habitat. In order to assess the impacts of the DWHOS on this habitat, two large-scale research programs, described herein, were designed and executed. These programs, ONSAP and DEEPEND, aimed to quantitatively characterize the oceanic ecosystem of the northern GoM and to establish a time-series with which natural and anthropogenic changes could be detected. The approach was multi-disciplinary in nature and included in situ sampling, acoustic sensing, water column profiling and sampling, satellite remote sensing, AUV sensing, numerical modeling, genetic sequencing, and biogeochemical analyses. The synergy of these methodologies has provided new and unprecedented perspectives of an oceanic ecosystem with respect to composition, connectivity, drivers, and variability.","Cook, April B.; Bernard, Andrea M.; Boswell, Kevin M.; Bracken-Grissom, Heather; D'Elia, Marta; DeRada, Sergio; Easson, Cole G.; English, David; Eytan, Ron, I; Frank, Tamara; Hu, Chuanmin; Johnston, Matthew W.; Judkins, Heather; Lembke, Chad; Lopez, Jose, V; Milligan, Rosanna J.; Moore, Jon A.; Penta, Bradley; Pruzinsky, Nina M.; Quinlan, John A.; Richards, Travis M.; Romero, Isabel C.; Shivji, Mahmood S.; Vecchione, Michael; Weber, Max D.; Wells, R.
