"1","assessing the effects of lateral hydrological connectivity alteration on freshwater ecosystems: a meta-analysis","The alteration of lateral hydrological connectivity (LHC) is among the major causes of decline in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services in river-floodplain ecosystems. Yet, the effects of LHC alteration on aquatic ecosystems have not been rigorously tested and synthesized. Here, we conducted a literature review and meta-analysis to provide a global synthesis of the effects of LHC alteration on aquatic ecosystems, and to test the effectiveness of indicators for bioassessment. In our review we found that the effects of LHC alteration were disproportionally documented in terms of geographic distribution and research subject. Most studies were conducted in Europe and America on the biodiversity and abundance of macroinvertebrates and fish. In our meta-analysis, we compared effect sizes between pairs of three LHC levels, i.e. disconnected, moderately connected, and highly connected. We found that only a limited number of water quality indicators (e.g. chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen) and biological community indicators (e.g. fish species richness, and zooplankton abundance) showed significant differences between LHC levels. The responses of these indicators to LHC alteration differed, and sometimes in opposing directions. We found out responsive indicators and their response trends, which could not only facilitate effective biomonitoring and bioassessment with regard to engineering and restoration of LHC, but also provide scientific underpinnings of the understanding of trade-offs among the indicators. We identified knowledge gaps and provided recommendations on how to fill these gaps, which included investigating rarely documented regions, developing new indicators, and quantifying mechanistic links between LHC and ecosystem functioning and services.","Shen, Minghua;Liu, Xueqin","Scholarly Journals","2021","125","2524279576","proquest","LY","ES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"2","greenhouse gas emissions from lakes along a permafrost gradient in western canada; climate feedback dominated by methane","Small lakes with organic-rich sediments are important global sources of methane and carbon dioxide, yet emission sensitivity at high latitudes to climate change is poorly known and likely influenced by warming temperatures and permafrost thaw. In this study we monitored 20 lakes along a 1700 km transect from continuous permafrost to south of the permafrost boundary within the Mackenzie River Basin, a major global peatland region. Methane and carbon dioxide emissions from lakes had opposing trends across the permafrost gradient from north to south, with methane emissions increasing fourfold while carbon dioxide fluxes shifted from net sources to net sinks. Parallel increases from north to south in base cation, nutrient, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations suggest increased lake hydrological connectivity with both deep groundwater and shallow peatland porewater. However, methane and carbon dioxide emissions were decoupled, despite both having latitudinal trends, potentially due to different environmental drivers. Methane emissions were positively correlated with increasing water temperature and lake depth. Conversely, carbon dioxide emissions were negatively correlated with increasing nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations, predominantly found in the sporadic and permafrost free permafrost zones. Permafrost conditions thus likely play a key role in regulating lake productivity and carbon dioxide exchange. Our results suggest that both direct impacts of temperature change and indirectly effects of permafrost thaw will interact strongly with climate warming to determine future net greenhouse gas balance. Using spatial trends and simple atmospheric perturbation models to project future lake greenhouse gas emissions suggests a positive net radiative forcing this century dominated by increasing methane emissions that is only partially offset by reduced carbon dioxide emissions.","Kuhn, M A A;Thompson, L;Olefeldt, D;Anonymous","Scholarly Journals","2020","2020","2541948953","proquest","LY","MB",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"3","so close, so far: differences in long-term chlorophyll a variability in three nearby estuarine-coastal stations","Three sampling stations located in the inner Patos Lagoon estuary, the lagoon's mouth and the adjacent coastal beach were visited monthly from the end of 1992 until 2014. The stations are in close proximity, but are distributed along saline and hydrological gradients and had never previously been analysed together. Our main questions were: (1) Are the monthly, seasonal and interannual variations in chlorophyll a (Chl a) similar for the three stations? (2) Is there any type of connectivity among the sites? (3) What forces are responsible for controlling phytoplankton variability at these stations? The three stations showed distinct Chl a variability patterns, with higher concentration and variability at the beach station, where the seasonal variation presented higher values between May and October, seemingly out of phase with the estuarine station, where higher values occurred between September and January. The lagoon's mouth station acted as a transit region and incorporated the variability of the estuarine and coastal regions, and all three stations showed a lasting long-term influence from the remote and large-scale phenomenon El Nino Southern Oscillation, El Nino and La Nina periods being characterized by an increase in rainfall and drought conditions, respectively, in the region. The three stations showed no clear connectivity since the cross correlation analysis did not indicate subsequent (more than one month) influence of any station on the others with regard to Chl a. However, a large transfer of the surf-zone diatom, Asterionellopsis guyunusae, from the coast towards the estuary was observed in an apparent 'inverted outwelling' process. Chl a variability did not show a straight relationship with most of the measured abiotic variables, indicating that other forces such as residence time may be of greater importance.","Abreu, Paulo Cesar;Marangoni, Juliano;Odebrecht, Clarisse","Scholarly Journals","2017","13","1919960982","proquest","LY","PG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"4","effects of lake-basin morphological and hydrological characteristics on the eutrophication of shallow lakes in eastern china","The Yangtze River floodplain contains numerous oxbow or riverine lakes, all of which were openly connected with the Yangtze River or its major tributaries prior to 1950s. However, stresses resulting from human settlement and utilization of catchment resources have exerted great pressures on these lake ecosystems changing their morphology, connectivity and trophic state lakes. This study examined the interaction of these changes and their impact on eutrophication for 90 shallow lakes in eastern China in 2008 to 2011. TN and TP in the study lakes had negative relationships with mean water depth (Zmean), but no single lake-basin characteristic was found to dominate chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) growth. Instead, water depth and surface area were found to interactively affect Chl-a concentrations in smaller lakes. That is, Chl-a concentration in the lakes with Zmean&gt;2m and surface area (SA)¤25km2 was significantly higher than that in relatively larger lakes with Zmean&gt;2m and SA&gt;25km2 (p-value¤0.038). Chl-a concentration was higher in the lakes located within the lower Yangtze River basin which had longer retention times, than in the lakes located within the middle Yangtze River basin, where flow velocity is relatively larger. As expected, the water quality was found to be better in the lakes hydraulically connected with rivers than in those isolated from the river. This study revealed that lake-basin morphology and hydrology dominated algal blooms in the highly eutrophic shallow lakes in eastern China.","Huang, Jian;Xu, Qiujin;Beidou Xi;Wang, Xixi;Jia, Keli;Huo, Shouliang;Su, Jing;Zhang, Ting;Li, Caole","Scholarly Journals","2014","40","2000316314","proquest","LY","RP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"5","spatial connectivity in a large river system: resolving the sources and fate of dissolved organic matter","Large rivers are generally heterogeneous and productive systems that receive important inputs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial and in situ sources. Thus, they are likely to play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of the DOM flowing to the oceans. The asymmetric spatial gradient driven by directional flow and environmental heterogeneity contributes to the fate of DOM flowing downstream. Yet, the relative effects of spatial connectivity and environmental heterogeneity on DOM dynamics are poorly understood. For example, since environmental variables show spatial heterogeneity, the variation explained by environmental and spatial variables may be redundant. We used the St. Lawrence River (SLR) as a representative large river to resolve the unique influences of environmental heterogeneity and spatial connectivity on DOM dynamics. We used three-dimensional fluorescence matrices combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to characterize the DOM pool in the SLR. Seven fluorophores were modeled, of which two were identified to be of terrestrial origin and three from algal exudates. We measured a set of environmental variables that are known to drive the fate of DOM in aquatic systems. Additionally, we used asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM) modeling to take spatial connectivity into account. The combination of spatial and environmental models explained 85% of the DOM variation. We show that spatial connectivity is an important driver of DOM dynamics, as a large fraction of environmental heterogeneity was attributable to the asymmetric spatial gradient. Along the longitudinal axis, we noted a rapid increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), mostly controlled by terrestrial input of DOM originating from the tributaries. Variance partitioning demonstrated that freshly produced protein-like DOM was found to be the preferential substrate for heterotrophic bacteria undergoing rapid proliferation, while humic-like DOM was more correlated to the diffuse attenuation coefficient of UVA radiation.","Massicotte, Philippe;Frenette, Jean-Jacques","Scholarly Journals","2011","21","903662303","proquest","LY","PG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"6","the significance of side-arm connectivity for carbon dynamics of the river danube, austria","1. Side-arms connected to the main stem of the river are key areas for biogeochemical cycling in fluvial landscapes, exhibiting high rates of carbon processing. 2. This work focused on quantifying autochthonous and allochthonous carbon pools and, thereby, on comparing transport and transformation processes in a restored side-arm system of the River Danube (Regelsbrunn). We established a carbon budget and quantified carbon processing from March to September 2003. In addition, data from previous studies during 1997 to 1999 were assessed. 3. Gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration were estimated by diel oxygen time curves and an oxygen mass balance. Plankton primary production was determined to estimate its contribution to GPP under different hydrological conditions. 4. Based on the degree of connectivity, three hydrological phases were differentiated. Most of the organic matter, dominated by allochthonous carbon, was transported in the main channel and through the side-arm during floods, while at intermediate and low flows (and thus connectivity), transformation processes became more important and autochthonous carbon dominated the carbon pool. The side-arm system functioned as a sink for particulate matter [total suspended solids and particulate organic carbon (POC)] and a source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chlorophyll-a. 5. Autochthonous primary production of 4.2 t C day¹ in the side-arm was equivalent to about 20% of the allochthonous inputs of 20 t C day¹ (POC and DOC) entering the area at mean flow (1% of the discharge of the main channel). Pelagic photosynthesis was generally high at mean flow (1.3-3.8 g C m² day¹), and contributed up to 90% of system productivity. During long stagnant periods at low discharge, the side-arm was controlled by biological processes and a shift from planktonic to benthic activity occurred (benthic primary production of 0.4-14 g C m² day¹). 6. The transformation of the organic matter that passes through the side-arm under different hydrological conditions, points to the importance of these subsystems in contributing autochthonous carbon to the food web of the main channel.","Preiner, S;Drozdowski, I;Schagerl, M;Schiemer, F;Hein, T","Scholarly Journals","2008","53","47516161","proquest","LY","RP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"7","hydrological connectivity and flood pulses as the central aspects for the integrity of a river-floodplain system","Interactions between the Danube river and its backwaters were analysed by determining the correspondence between river fluctuation and ground- and back-water levels and the extent of surface connectivity within the river floodplain at different water levels. Samples from a longitudinal and a lateral transect taken during low water mean water, high water and flood were analysed for inorganic nutrients, suspended solids and chlorophyll-a. In longitudinal, connectivity decreased with distance from the Danube. At low water sample there was no surface connection between the river and its backwaters. Conditions in backwaters were determined by internal processes, characterized by low concentrations of nutrients and suspended solids. As water levels increased, local surface inflow and seepage caused nutrient pulses and eutrophication. The significance of flood pulses for dynamics of biological processes was emphasized by short-term changes. The response of different water bodies depended on connectivity to the river. Floods reset the ecosystem at an earlier successional stage. In the pelagic zone, floods removed biota and established initial set points.","Heiler, G;Hein, T;Schiemer, F;Bornette, G","Scholarly Journals","1995","11","13645558","proquest","LY","MB",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"8","changing characteristics and driving factors of trophic state of lakes in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river in the past 30 years","To understand the current eutrophication status, main drivers of eutrophication and restoration strategy of Yangtze-connected or Yangtze-isolated lakes (historically connected to the Yangtze River but isolated by artificial dikes currently), the trophic parameters and main water quality variables were surveyed seasonally in 27 large lakes and reservoirs of this region during 2017 to 2018. In addition, the temporal eutrophication dynamics and associated driving mechanisms of these lakes over the past 30 years were analyzed based on the historical data of these lakes (investigated during 1988 to 1992 and 2008). Our results showed that most of the lakes in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River were eutrophic now, and significantly worse than the status of 1988 to 1992, mainly contributed by chlorophyll-a of phytoplankton and total phosphorus. Human activities, including changes of water retention time (primarily depend on the lake-Yangtze connection condition), fishery activities, catchment pollution condition, and lake restoration are decisive factors in shaping the eutrophication status of these lakes. Comparing with the historical records, phytoplankton chlorophyll-a and associated organic matter concentrations are increased drastically, while nutrients (e.g., total phosphorus and nitrogen) experienced relatively small increase, yet. Therefore, it is suggested that the non-nutrients factors were the major causes which strengthen the eutrophication risk. From the perspective of restoration strategies of lakes in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River, it is crucial that rebuild the hydrological connectivity, restore natural water level fluctuation, optimize the fishery management and enhance the catchment nutrient abatement ability and applying the in-lake restoration engineering.","Zhu Guangwei; Xu Hai; Zhu Mengyuan; Zou Wei; Guo Chaoxuan; Ji Pengfei; Da Wenye; Zhou Yongqiang; Zhang Yunlin; Qin Boqiang","Scholarly Journals","2019","31","BIOSIS:PREV202000014603","wos","LY","RP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"9","freshwater inflow and responses from estuaries across a climatic gradient: an assessment of northwestern gulf of mexico estuaries based on stable isotopes","Estuaries exist across a large climatic gradient in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, capturing a range of hydrologic conditions and estuarine functioning. We examined freshwater inflow, salinity, and stable isotope compositions (delta C-13, delta N-15) of oysters, suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM), and surface sediment organic matter (SSOM) from five estuaries across the hydrologic gradient. All five estuaries experienced large decreases in freshwater inflow over the last 40 yr, with three estuaries being subject to freshwater inflow reductions of more than 85%. Generally, these freshwater inflow decreases were associated with estuarine salinity increases. Across the spatial gradient, average salinity generally increased from northeast to southwest estuaries. SPOM in the northeastern, lower salinity estuaries generally contained more continental organic matter and was of higher quality (i.e., lower C/chlorophyll a ratio), as compared to southwestern, higher salinity estuaries. Similarly, both SSOM and oyster delta C-13 values were positively correlated with salinity, further highlighting that food webs in lower salinity estuaries are more greatly influenced by continental organic matter than those in higher salinity estuaries. A decrease in the connectivity between continental and coastal habitats may have broad consequences for flows of organic matter, and estuarine function and health. Conducting studies across large-scale hydrologic gradients can provide a useful approach to informing and predicting shifts in estuarine functioning.","Marshall, Danielle A.; La Peyre, Megan K.; Palmer, Terence A.; Guillou, Gael; Sterba-Boatwright, Blair D.; Pollack, Jennifer Beseres; Lebreton, Benoit","Scholarly Journals","2021","66","BIOSIS:PREV202100871021","wos","LY","CP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"10","metal pollution in the pearl river estuary and implications for estuary management: the influence of hydrological connectivity associated with estuarine mixing","Understanding the metal pollution can help governments and estuary management groups manage metal inputs. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the behaviors of seven metals Cd, Zn, Cu, As, Pb, Cr, and Hg in water and the responses of these metals to hydrological connectivity in the Pearl River Estuary. The analyses were based on the field measurements of August-2016 in the estuary and January-2016 in the upper river mouth. We also assessed the ecosystem health of these metals. Overall, this estuary had an overall moderate pollution level, with occasional severe perturbations. The mean concentration of individual metal was in the order of Zn > As > Cu > Cr > Pb > Cd > Hg. The eastern estuary was more heavily polluted by metals (notably, Zn, Cd, and Cu) than the western estuary; this condition was attributable to sewage and industrial effluent discharges from the eastern urban cities of Dongguan and Shenzhen. Longitudinally, high levels of Cd and Zn appeared in the upper estuary, while elevated levels of Cu, As, Pb, Cr, and Hg were found in the middle and lower estuaries. The riverine inputs and estuarine mixing significantly influenced the distribution and movement of trace metals in the estuary, and have contributed to phytoplankton productivity (chlorophyll-a > 10 mu g/L). River inflow inhibited the vertical diffusion of metals, and tidal currents facilitated surface-to-bottom mixing. Cu and Cd posed ecological risks. We determined the source contributions and transport routes of the metals using principal component analysis combining with multiple linear regression. The results of this study suggest that the source apportionment of metals can help to manage the source input entering into the estuary. Further, identified hydrological connectivity of metals can inform water quality managers in the highly anthropogenically influenced estuary.","Niu, Lixia; Cai, Huayang; Jia, Liangwen; Luo, Xiangxin; Tao, Wei; Dong, Yanhong; Yang, Qingshu","Scholarly Journals","2021","225","BIOSIS:PREV202100881636","wos","LY","PG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"11","the spatial ecology of phytoplankton blooms in uk canals","Environmental change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of problems caused by harmful algal blooms. We investigated the ecology of phytoplankton blooms in UK canals to determine the environmental predictors and spatial structure of bloom communities. The results revealed a significant increase in bloom presence with increasing elevation. As predicted, higher temperatures were associated with a greater probability of blooms, but the relationship between temperature and bloom occurrence changed across landscapes. At the minimum level of agricultural land, the probability of bloom presence increased with increasing temperature. Conversely, at the maximum level, the probability decreased with increasing temperature. This pattern could be due to higher temperatures increasing phytoplankton growth rates despite lower nutrient concentrations at low levels of agricultural land, and nutrient depletion by rapidly growing blooms at high levels of agricultural land and temperatures. Community composition exhibited spatial autocorrelation; nearby blooms were more similar than distant blooms. Hydrological distances through the canal network showed a stronger association with community dissimilarity than Euclidean distances, suggesting a role for hydrological connectivity in driving bloom formation and composition. This new knowledge regarding canal phytoplankton bloom origin and ecology could help inform measures to inhibit bloom formation.","Kelly, Leah A.; Hassall, Christopher","Scholarly Journals","2018","8","BIOSIS:PREV201900249102","wos","LY","MB",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"12","a multidisciplinary approach to investigate deep-pelagic ecosystem dynamics in the gulf of mexico following deepwater horizon","The pelagic Gulf of Mexico (GoM) is a complex system of dynamic physical oceanography (western boundary current, mesoscale eddies), high biological diversity, and community integration via diel vertical migration and lateral advection. Humans also heavily utilize this system, including its deep-sea components, for resource extraction, shipping, tourism, and other commercial activity. This utilization has had impacts, some with disastrous consequences. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DWHOS) occurred at a depth of similar to 1500 m (Macondo wellhead), creating a persistent and toxic mixture of hydrocarbons and dispersant in the deep-pelagic (water column below 200 m depth) habitat. In order to assess the impacts of the DWHOS on this habitat, two large-scale research programs, described herein, were designed and executed. These programs, ONSAP and DEEPEND, aimed to quantitatively characterize the oceanic ecosystem of the northern GoM and to establish a time-series with which natural and anthropogenic changes could be detected. The approach was multi-disciplinary in nature and included in situ sampling, acoustic sensing, water column profiling and sampling, satellite remote sensing, AUV sensing, numerical modeling, genetic sequencing, and biogeochemical analyses. The synergy of these methodologies has provided new and unprecedented perspectives of an oceanic ecosystem with respect to composition, connectivity, drivers, and variability.","Cook, April B.; Bernard, Andrea M.; Boswell, Kevin M.; Bracken-Grissom, Heather; D'Elia, Marta; DeRada, Sergio; Easson, Cole G.; English, David; Eytan, Ron, I; Frank, Tamara; Hu, Chuanmin; Johnston, Matthew W.; Judkins, Heather; Lembke, Chad; Lopez, Jose, V; Milligan, Rosanna J.; Moore, Jon A.; Penta, Bradley; Pruzinsky, Nina M.; Quinlan, John A.; Richards, Travis M.; Romero, Isabel C.; Shivji, Mahmood S.; Vecchione, Michael; Weber, Max D.; Wells, R.

"138","influence of hydrological connectivity on winter limnology in floodplain lakes of the saskatchewan river delta, saskatchewan","Globally, hydrological connectivity between rivers and their floodplains has been reduced by river flow management and land transformation. The Saskatchewan River Delta is North America's largest inland delta and a hub for fish and fur production. To determine the influence of connectivity on limnology within this northern floodplain, water chemistry and stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) were analyzed during the winter of 2014 in 26 shallow lakes along a hydrological gradient. A total of five lake connectivity categories were determined by optical remote sensing imagary of surface water coverage area from years of varying flood intensities. Accuracy of categories was verified by degree of O-18 and H-2 enrichment within lakes. Both isotopes showed marked successional enrichment between connectivity categories, with more isolated lakes exhibiting greater enrichment. Water chemistry in lakes with greater connectivity to the main channel were characterized by higher pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and sulfates and lower total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and ammonium compared with more isolated lakes. These findings illustrate how connectivity influences water chemistry in northern floodplain lakes and how it might determine the suitability of these lakes as winter refuge for fishes. Additionally, our study provides supporting evidence for the effective use of optical remote sensing imagery, an inexpensive and accessible source of data for researchers, when determining connectivity characteristics of large northern floodplain systems. Additionally, this study provides further evidence that the inundation of floodplain lakes by river water during peak discharge has an impact on the conditions within the lakes long into the winter ice-cover season. Understanding the year-round influence of river-floodplain connection is imperative for assessing potential impacts of climate change and future water regulation on such ecosystems.","MacKinnon, Brett D.; Sagin, Jay; Baulch, Helen M.; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich; Jardine, Timothy D.","Scholarly Journals","2016","73","BIOSIS:PREV201600234351","wos","CP","LY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Results lend evidence to the importance of the hydrological regime on the dynamic of limnological variables in floodplain lakes. A dilution of nutrients in the lagoon, especially phosphates, occurred during floods. This was followed by fertilization of the environment by nutrients from the inundated marginal regions.

"53","functional indicators of stream health: a river-basin approach","Summary1. The efficacy of leaf-litter decomposition, sediment respiration, biofilm biomass, growth, chlorophyll a concentration and the autotrophic index (biofilm ash-free dry mass-chlorophyll a) and fungal biomass for detecting human-induced change was evaluated using 24 references and 15 disturbed stream sites located in central Portugal.2. Decomposition rates of alder (Alnus glutinosa) and oak (Quercus robur) leaves and sediment respiration rates were effective in discriminating impairment. Decomposition was negatively correlated with abiotic factors, such as ammonium and nitrite concentrations, connectivity and alterations in the hydrological regime, and positively correlated with nitrate concentration and oxygen concentration. Sediment respiration rates were correlated with organic contamination, land use and morphological changes.3. Growth rates of biofilm, concentration of chlorophyll a and the autotrophic index, although 41-73% higher at disturbed compared to reference sites, were not significantly different. These three variables were significantly correlated with total organic carbon, oxygen concentration, pH, nitrite and the presence of dams. Fungal biomass on leaves and biofilm biomass on natural substrata did not differ between reference and disturbed sites.4. Our findings lend support to the use of functional variables like decomposition and sediment respiration in monitoring and when used together with structural variables should give a more holistic measure of stream health.","FEIO, MJ;Alves, T;BOAVIDA, M;Medeiros, A;Graca, Mas","Scholarly Journals","2010","55","746081344","proquest","PG","LY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
