assessing the effects of lateral hydrological connectivity alteration on freshwater ecosystems a meta analysis,"The alteration of lateral hydrological connectivity (LHC) is among the major causes of decline in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services in river-floodplain ecosystems. Yet, the effects of LHC alteration on aquatic ecosystems have not been rigorously tested and synthesized. Here, we conducted a literature review and meta-analysis to provide a global synthesis of the effects of LHC alteration on aquatic ecosystems, and to test the effectiveness of indicators for bioassessment. In our review we found that the effects of LHC alteration were disproportionally documented in terms of geographic distribution and research subject. Most studies were conducted in Europe and America on the biodiversity and abundance of macroinvertebrates and fish. In our meta-analysis, we compared effect sizes between pairs of three LHC levels, i.e. disconnected, moderately connected, and highly connected. We found that only a limited number of water quality indicators (e.g. chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen) and biological community indicators (e.g. fish species richness, and zooplankton abundance) showed significant differences between LHC levels. The responses of these indicators to LHC alteration differed, and sometimes in opposing directions. We found out responsive indicators and their response trends, which could not only facilitate effective biomonitoring and bioassessment with regard to engineering and restoration of LHC, but also provide scientific underpinnings of the understanding of trade-offs among the indicators. We identified knowledge gaps and provided recommendations on how to fill these gaps, which included investigating rarely documented regions, developing new indicators, and quantifying mechanistic links between LHC and ecosystem functioning and services.","Shen, Minghua;Liu, Xueqin",Scholarly Journals,2021,125,2524279576,proquest,LY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
greenhouse gas emissions from lakes along a permafrost gradient in western canada climate feedback dominated by methane,"Small lakes with organic-rich sediments are important global sources of methane and carbon dioxide, yet emission sensitivity at high latitudes to climate change is poorly known and likely influenced by warming temperatures and permafrost thaw. In this study we monitored 20 lakes along a 1700 km transect from continuous permafrost to south of the permafrost boundary within the Mackenzie River Basin, a major global peatland region. Methane and carbon dioxide emissions from lakes had opposing trends across the permafrost gradient from north to south, with methane emissions increasing fourfold while carbon dioxide fluxes shifted from net sources to net sinks. Parallel increases from north to south in base cation, nutrient, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations suggest increased lake hydrological connectivity with both deep groundwater and shallow peatland porewater. However, methane and carbon dioxide emissions were decoupled, despite both having latitudinal trends, potentially due to different environmental drivers. Methane emissions were positively correlated with increasing water temperature and lake depth. Conversely, carbon dioxide emissions were negatively correlated with increasing nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations, predominantly found in the sporadic and permafrost free permafrost zones. Permafrost conditions thus likely play a key role in regulating lake productivity and carbon dioxide exchange. Our results suggest that both direct impacts of temperature change and indirectly effects of permafrost thaw will interact strongly with climate warming to determine future net greenhouse gas balance. Using spatial trends and simple atmospheric perturbation models to project future lake greenhouse gas emissions suggests a positive net radiative forcing this century dominated by increasing methane emissions that is only partially offset by reduced carbon dioxide emissions.","Kuhn, M A A;Thompson, L;Olefeldt, D;Anonymous",Scholarly Journals,2020,2020,2541948953,proquest,LY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
do environmental variables predict the trophic structure of fish fauna in a subtropical river uruguay river ecoregion ,"Trophic interactions represent the routes through which energy flows upwards within ecosystems and the understanding of such structuring under varying environmental conditions is still challenging. Here we test the hypothesis that differences in environmental variables act as environmental filters on the composition and trophic structure of local the fish fauna of a subtropical mountain river. We predict that differences in the trophic structure of the fish fauna occur along the river continuum. Main environmental parameters have been measured and fishes were sampled quarterly between August 2013 and May 2014 at six sampling sites in the main channel of the Pelotas River, Upper Uruguay ecoregion. We collected 3848 individuals belonging to 38 species, 4 orders and 11 families. The most (82.1%) consisted of small- and medium-sized individuals. The species were classified into eight trophic guilds: aquatic insectivorous, carnivorous, detritivorous, detritivorous/aquatic insectivorous, herbivorous, iliophagous, omnivorous and piscivorous. In general, herbivorous and piscivorous guilds were the most representative in both number and biomass. Significant differences detected by Permanova were for richness, numerical abundance and biomass between all the sites sampled. Relationships between the environmental variables and the composition of trophic guilds were observed along the longitudinal gradient by RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. The abundance of guilds omnivorous, aquatic insectivorous and herbivorous increases with higher values of chlorophyll- a and vegetation cover, especially characterizing the upstream sites (S1, S2 and S3). On the other hand, the abundance of the iliophagous, detritivorous/insectivorous and piscivorous guilds increases with greater values of width, temperature, inorganic phosphorus and total solids, a fact observed in downstream sites (S4, S5 and S6). Thus, it was possible to identify a clear variation in the trophic structure of the fish fauna along the Pelotas River (upstream-downstream), in which the local variables were efficient in predicting environmental filters that influence the trophic organization. In this scenario, our study follows the longitudinal model and evidences a greater accumulation of energy in food webs in the upstream-downstream direction, which favors the greatest abundance of piscivorous, detritivorous and iliophagous verified in stretches of greater volume and dimensions of river. These results highlight the importance of the local variables and the interrelationships in the lateral connectivity processes along the river continuum.","Neves, Mayara P;Baumgartner, Dirceu;Baumgartner, Gilmar;Delariva, Rosilene L",Scholarly Journals,2018,77,2417690740,proquest,LY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
towards deconfounding hydrological and seasonal temperature variability in the determination of selected limnological variables of a temperate floodplain ecosystem,"This paper presents a methodological approach that can aid the assessment of variation in limnological variables in response to hydrological phases and seasonal temperature variation. The investigation was conducted in the Danube River floodplain, Kopacki Rit, Croatia. The proposed approach facilitates a more accurate examination of the effects of first factor, while maintaining second factor less variable, and vice versa. Samples were collected in the floodplain channel and lake along a temporal connectivity gradient, and were grouped according to three hydrological phases (isolation, flow pulse and flood pulse) and according to three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). A permutational multivariate analysis of variance was used to analyse the hydrological effects within seasons, as well as seasonal effects within hydrological phases on selected limnological variables: pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nitrites, nitrates, ammonium, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a concentrations and ratio of copiotrophic to oligotrophic bacteria. A multivariate data cloud was structured by hydrological phases during all investigated seasons, but not by all seasons during different hydrological phases. The strongest impact of hydrological phases on limnological variables occurred during summer. Seasonal effects were significant during the isolation and the flood pulse phases. The flow pulse phase somehow obscured the effects of seasonal change, resulting in temporal floodplain homogenization. One possible explanation is that water temperature determines potential limnological conditions, whereas hydrology determines actual conditions. Such results must be taken into account if the accurate effects of hydrology and seasonal change are to be assessed in temperate floodplain ecosystems.

short term succession of aquatic plant species richness along ecosystem productivity and dispersal gradients in shallow lakes,"Questions: The highest species richness is usually expected at an intermediate stage of development since the last major disturbance event, but some studies have shown that ecosystem productivity and dispersal may modify this pattern, suggesting the need for further studies on the effects of productivity and dispersal on the dynamics of species richness through succession. In this study, we analysed aquatic plant species richness in relation to (1) succession stage, measured as numbers of years since the last disturbance that affected the ecosystems; (2) lake productivity, measured as the chlorophyll a concentration; and (3) connectivity to similar nearby ecosystems, a proxy for the potential input of diaspores. Location: Shallow lakes of the Dombes region, France. Methods: Every 5-7 yr these shallow lakes are emptied and left to dry out for 1 yr. These drought disturbances lead to complete destruction of the submerged aquatic plant communities. Sixty lakes arranged along a gradient of productivity were selected. The probability of diaspore input was considered to increase from upstream to downstream, as lakes are organized in hydrologically connected networks via ditches, through which the downstream lakes receive water from the upstream lakes. For each lake, the aquatic plant species richness (from systematic summer vegetation sampling), time since the last disturbance (last summer drying), productivity (estimated as chlorophyll a concentration) and probability of diaspore input (assessed from position in the network) were recorded. Results: The aquatic plant species richness decreased with the time since the last disturbance for all of the lakes, but there was a significant interaction with the chlorophyll a concentration and position of the lake in the network. At the lowest ecosystem productivities, the relationship between successional stage and species richness was hump-shaped, whereas the species richness decreased with increasing time since the last disturbance when productivity increased. The lake's position in the network did not influence species richness during the first 2 yr after disturbance, but from year 3 and thereafter, lakes connected to high numbers of upstream lakes consistently exhibited decreased richness, contradicting the expected trend of increasing species richness with increasing diaspore inputs. Conclusions: This study indicates that both ecosystem productivity and connectivity strongly affected the relationship between aquatic plant species richness and succession, and that these factors should be taken into account in further developments of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. In this study, we analysed the effect of the lake productivity and the lake connectivity on the relationship between aquatic plant species richness and the succession stage. These factors affected the dynamics of species richness through succession and they should be taken into account in further developments of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. © 2012 International Association for Vegetation Science.","Arthaud, F;Vallod, D;Robin, J;Bornette, G;Wezel, A",Scholarly Journals,2013,24,1315882897,proquest,LY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
factors influencing algal biomass in intermittently connected subtropical coastal ponds,"Microalgae may contribute more to salt marsh productivity than realized, underscoring the importance of understanding algal dynamics in such systems. Benthic and planktonic chlorophyll-a (surrogate for total algal biomass), sediment ash-free dry weight, total suspended solids, salinity, and nutrients were examined in intermittently connected marsh ponds in the subtropical Guadalupe Estuary, Texas, USA to determine the effects of hydrologic connections on algal biomass in this system. From May 2005 to May 2006, several high water events resulting in surface water connections between ponds and nearby tidal creeks occurred, followed by disconnection and, at times, pond desiccation. During periods of disconnection, algal biomass was higher in both the benthos and the water column than during connection events when flushing occurred. Since connection events did not increase NOx, the primary source of dissolved inorganic nitrogen seemed to be nutrient cycling within the ponds. Data at the aggregated level, i.e., chlorophyll-a, indicated this system followed the flood pulse concept. During high water events, algal biomass may be exported to supplement the tidal creek food web (aquatic), whereas during low water events accumulated biomass within the ponds feed the marsh food web (terrestrial), which includes blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and the whooping crane (Grus americana).","Miller, Carrie J;Davis, Stephen E;Roelke, Daniel L;Li, Hsiu-Ping;Driffill, Matthew J",Scholarly Journals,2009,29,21126083,proquest,LY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
transversal and lateral exciton energy transfer in grana thylakoids of spinach,"The excitation energy transfer between photosystem (PS) II complexes was studied in isolated grana disks and thylakoids using chlorophyll a fluorescence induction measurements in the presence of DCMU under stacked and destacked conditions. Destacking of grana was achieved using a sonication protocol in a buffer without MgCl 2 . The degree of stacking was controlled and quantified by atomic force microscopy and by the concomitant absorption changes. As expected from the literature, intact thylakoids showed a strong dependency of the connectivity of PSII centers, the F m /F o ratio as well as the fraction of PSII(beta) centers on the MgCl 2 concentration. In contrast, these parameters did not change in isolated grana disks. In particular, the connectivity remained constantly high irrespective of the degree of destacking. These differences were explained by the high protein density in grana disks, which hinders separation and mixing of proteins sufficiently to change energy transfer properties. Due to the occurrence of stroma lamella in intact thylakoids, intermixing of PSII and PSI is possible and allows for changes in F m /F o ratio as is the separation of LHCII from PSII, thus leading to an increase in the fraction of PSII(beta). Even if mixing and separation of proteins are impaired in isolated grana disks, destacking should lead to a decrease in connectivity if transversal excitation energy transfer between two opposite membranes is significant. Because the connectivity is constant over all degrees of destacking employed, we conclude that the energy transfer in granas is mainly lateral.","Kirchhoff, H;Borinski, M;Lenhert, S;Chi, L;Büchel, C",Scholarly Journals,2004,NA,925361516,proquest,LY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
spatial variability of chlorophyll a and abiotic variables in a river floodplain system during different hydrological phases,"Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and abiotic variables were measured in the main channel and floodplain waterbodies of the Middle Parana River to analyse the system dynamics and to assess their spatial variability during different hydrological phases, including an extreme flood. We wanted to test that the flood does not always have a homogenising effect in a river-floodplain system. An explanatory model for Chl-a was performed according to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), and the relation of water level with the coefficient of variation (CV) among sites for each variable was explored. The model explained 64% of Chl-a variability. Water level, depth:euphotic zone ratio (Z (d):Z (eu)) (inverse correlation) and conductivity (direct correlation) were the significant explicative variables. The CV of Chl-a decreased with flood from the main channel to the floodplain, but for turbidity, Z (d):Z (eu), pH, dissolved oxygen, soluble reactive phosphorus and Chl-a:pheophytin-a ratio, it increased. However, within the floodplain, CV of turbidity, Z (d):Z (eu) and pH decreased during flood. These suggest that the homogenising effect frequently observed during inundation cannot be generalised and that the floodplain may maintain its identity even during flood. The extreme flood and its overlap with the warm season and sedimentological pulse probably contributed to the heterogeneity in the spatial gradient.","Mayora, Gisela; Devercelli, Melina; Giri, Federico",Scholarly Journals,2013,717,BIOSIS:PREV201300670242,wos,LY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
trophic state and water quality in the danube floodplain lake kopacki rit nature park croatia in relation to hydrological connectivity,"The investigated floodplain lake is located in the marginal part of the Kopacki Rit Nature Park, Croatia, a floodplain area of the Danube. In this chapter, we have assessed the influence of hydrological connectivity with the main channel on the trophic state and water quality in the Lake Sakadas. The evaluation of trophic state combines a number of physical, chemical and biological parameters with the objective to select the relevant indicators for the floodplain lakes. The following environmental parameters have been considered: water temperature, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, water transparency, chlorophyll-a concentration, phytoplankton primary productivity, benthic and periphytic communities and laboratory experiments (nutrient enrichment bioassay). An integrative approach, which includes in situ research and laboratory experiments, indicated strong correlations of abiotic and biotic components with a hydrological regime. Also, during the biological monitoring, occurrence and spread of invasive species was noted as an indication of ecosystem disturbance (hydrological and/or anthropogenic). Therefore, our results contribute to the perception of importance of the hydrological connectivity (by inundation) on the eutrophication process in the investigated floodplain lake.","Persic, Vesna; Cerba, Dubravka; Bogut, Irella; Horvatic, Janja",Books,2011,NA,BIOSIS:PREV201100325239,wos,LY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
benthic algal response to hyporheic surface water exchange in an alluvial river,"We studied the response of benthic algae to points of hyporheic-surface water exchange in the main channel of the Middle Fork Flathead River within the Nyack Flood Plain, Montana. We examined hyporheic exchange at 120 sites using piezometers and measuring vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG), hydraulic conductivity, and vertical discharge. We removed benthic algae from a single cobble at each site, and we used VHG to group sampling sites for statistical analysis. Algal cell density and chlorophyll a concentration were significantly higher at sites with hyporheic discharge (+VHG, upwelling) compared to both sites with hyporheic recharge (-VHG, downwelling) and sites with no hyporheic-surface water exchange (=VHG, neutral) (ANOVA, P < 0.05). The assemblages of algae at upwelling sites were also significantly different from downwelling and neutral exchange sites (ANOSIM, P < 0.05). Filamentous green algae Stigeoclonium sp. and Zygnema sp. and a chrysophyte, Hydrurus foetidus (Villars) Trevisan were abundant at upwelling sites, whereas an assemblage of diatoms Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kutzing) Czarnecki, Cymbella excisa Kutzing, Diatoma moniliformis Kutzing, and Gomphonema olivaceoides Hustedt, were the most abundant taxa at downwelling and neutral exchange sites, occurring attached to, or in close association with the stalks of Didymosphenia geminata (Lyngbye) Schmidt. These data show that benthic algal communities are structured differently depending on the direction of hyporheic flux in the main channel of a large alluvial river, suggesting that hyporheic-surface exchange may influence the spatial distribution of main-channel benthic algae in rivers with hyporheic-surface water connectivity.","Wyatt, Kevin H.; Hauer, F.

terrestrialization alters organic matter dynamics and habitat quality for freshwater mussels unionoida in floodplain backwaters,"Anthropogenically induced reduction in flood inundation frequency often leads to terrestrialisation, which accompanies establishment and expansions of tree cover on areas formerly with little or no trees. We tested hypotheses that terrestrialisation degrades habitat for freshwater mussels (Unionoida: Unio douglasiae nipponensis and Lanceolaria grayana) by changing the organic matter (OM) dynamics in floodplain backwaters.Stable isotope composition of seston, periphyton, fine and coarse benthic particulate OM (FBPOM and CBPOM) and mussel tissues was measured to understand OM dynamics and food webs in 14 backwaters in the middle segment of the Kiso River, Japan. Isotope ratios, C:N ratio and chlorophyll a as a proxy of food resource characteristics and the frequency of hypoxia were related to mussel growth rates.delta C-13 of seston, periphyton and FBPOM was low at sites with lower inundation frequency (a greater degree of terrestrialisation), whereas such a trend was not observed for CBPOM (i.e. riparian leaf litter). Mussels fed exclusively on seston or mixtures of seston and periphyton with their delta C-13 tracking fluctuations in food resources.Sestonic delta C-13 differences were attributed to changes in dominant carbon origin from predominantly river-borne to autochthonous sources, while periphytic delta C-13 differences were possibly caused by a varying level of dependence on respiratory CO2. FBPOM-delta C-13 differences were associated with a greater contribution of CBPOM to the FBPOM pool in infrequently flooded backwaters. Variability in mussel growth was more closely related to hypoxia than food resource characteristics.We inferred that terrestrialisation changes quality of seston and benthic detritus and degrades habitat conditions largely by accumulating riparian leaf litter in the benthic detrital pool and increasing the frequency of hypoxia. The removal of riparian trees may temporarily improve habitat condition in backwaters heavily affected by terrestrialisation. However, ecological integrity in the long run requires the recovery of the process that suppresses terrestrialisation, which includes restoration of incised channels and flood pulses.","Negishi, Junjiro N.; Katsuki, Kotaro; Kume, Manabu; Nagayama, Shigeya; Kayaba, Yuichi",Scholarly Journals,2014,59,BIOSIS:PREV201400370733,wos,LY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
assessing the potential health risk of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in lake naivasha kenya,"This study discerned the causes of cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Naivasha (Kenya). We hypothesized that phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass respond to hydrologic cycles, peaking during the wet season, and that microcystin (MC) concentrations are highest following the bloom collapse. Hydrologic loading (inferred from rainfall and lake level changes) and phytoplankton responses in two basins of the lake were monitored over a wet season followed by a dry season between September 2010 and March 2011. Results show that both phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass peaked in both basins during the wet season, with associated peaks in particulate MC concentrations. Even though phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass were higher in the smaller deep basin, MC concentrations were lower than in the large shallow basin. The high-MC levels during the wet season were followed by a greater MC production per cyanobacteria biomass unit in the dry season in both basins. The timing of the cyanobacteria bloom suggests that its formation was likely controlled by large nutrient influxes from the contributing catchment to the lake associated with intense rainfall following an intense drought, posing a risk to the health of the community due to increased MC levels.","Raffoul, M.
