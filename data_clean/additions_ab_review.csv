"1","dissolved organic matter characterization in soils and streams in a small coastal low-arctic catchment","r3_25","Ag_search_issue","Ongoing climate warming in the western Canadian Arctic is leading to thawing of permafrost soils and subsequent mobilization of its organic matter pool. Part of this mobilized terrestrial organic matter enters the aquatic system as dissolved organic matter (DOM) and is laterally transported from land to sea. Mobilized organic matter is an important source of nutrients for ecosystems, as it is available for microbial breakdown, and thus a source of greenhouse gases. We are beginning to understand spatial controls on the release of DOM as well as the quantities and fate of this material in large Arctic rivers. Yet, these processes remain systematically understudied in small, high-Arctic watersheds, despite the fact that these watersheds experience the strongest warming rates in comparison. Here, we sampled soil (active layer and permafrost) and water (porewater and stream water) from a small ice wedge polygon (IWP) catchment along the Yukon coast, Canada, during the summer of 2018. We assessed the organic carbon (OC) quantity (using dissolved (DOC) and particulate OC (POC) concentrations and soil OC content), quality ( δ 13 C DOC, optical properties and source apportionment) and bioavailability (incubations; optical indices such as slope ratio, S r ; and humification index, HIX) along with stream water properties (temperature, T ; pH; electrical conductivity, EC; and water isotopes). We classify and compare different landscape units and their soil horizons that differ in microtopography and hydrological connectivity, giving rise to differences in drainage capacity. Our results show that porewater DOC concentrations and yield reflect drainage patterns and waterlogged conditions in the watershed. DOC yield (in mg DOC g - 1 soil OC ) generally increases with depth but shows a large variability near the transition zone (around the permafrost table). Active-layer porewater DOC generally is more labile than permafrost DOC, due to various reasons (heterogeneity, presence of a paleo-active-layer and sampling strategies). Despite these differences, the very long transport times of porewater DOC indicate that substantial processing occurs in soils prior to release into streams. Within the stream, DOC strongly dominates over POC, illustrated by DOC / POC ratios around 50, yet storm events decrease that ratio to around 5. Source apportionment of stream DOC suggests a contribution of around 50 % from permafrost/deep-active-layer OC, which contrasts with patterns observed in large Arctic rivers (12 ± 8 %; Wild et al.,&#xa0;2019). Our 10 d monitoring period demonstrated temporal DOC patterns on multiple scales (i.e.,&#xa0;diurnal patterns, storm events and longer-term trends), underlining the need for high-resolution long-term monitoring. First estimates of Black Creek annual DOC (8.2 ± 6.4 t DOC yr - 1 ) and POC (0.21 ± 0.20 t yr - 1 ) export allowed us to make a rough upscaling towards the entire Yukon Coastal Plain (34.51 ± 2.7 kt DOC yr - 1 and 8.93 ± 8.5 kt POC yr - 1 ). Rising Arctic temperatures, increases in runoff, soil organic matter (OM) leaching, permafrost thawing and primary production are likely to increase the net lateral OC flux. Consequently, altered lateral fluxes may have strong impacts on Arctic aquatic ecosystems and Arctic carbon cycling.","Speetjens, Niek Jesse;Tanski, George;Martin, Victoria;Wagner, Julia;Richter, Andreas;Hugelius, Gustaf;Boucher, Chris;Lodi, Rachele;Knoblauch, Christian;Koch, Boris P;Wünsch, Urban;Lantuit, Hugues;Vonk, Jorien E","2022","Agricultural & Environmental Science Collection","pro","MB","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"2","hydrologic influence on stream water nitrogen to phosphorus ratios","r3_26","Ag_search_issue","Watersheds and their complex network of flow paths regulate the movement of water and nutrients to aquatic ecosystems. Overland and subsurface (soil and ground water) flow paths transport nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) with differing levels of efficiency; P transport occurs via surface flow paths almost exclusively and N transport can utilize both overland and subsurface flow paths. Stream water N:P ratios influence ecosystem community composition, nutrient limitation of primary production, and trophic dynamics. Regional patterns of stream water N:P ratios have been identified, however, the controls driving the pattern remains poorly understood. This dissertation hypothesizes that watershed flow paths control the regional variation of stream water N:P ratios. Three independent lines of evidence were pursued to address the hypothesis: (i) a field study that quantified watershed flow paths and stream water N:P ratios in two watersheds with distinctly different hydrology; (ii) a watershed modeling exercise that simulated many different precipitation regimes and recorded the resulting flow paths and N:P ratios; (iii) a data synthesis of 58 minimally-impacted watersheds across the United States that focused on the relationship between stream water N:P ratios and stream discharge. The results from the three studies all indicate that watershed flow paths influence stream water N:P ratios. Furthermore, the results from all lines of evidence identify a possible scaling relationship between N:P ratios and stream discharge across large temporal and spatial ranges. The results suggest that watershed connectivity with the stream, defined as the sum of the active watershed flow paths, is a fundamental condition that helps explain the variability of N:P ratios, and has important implications for the watershed transport of other elements. Such information allows more informed management of aquatic ecosystems in a changing environment.","Green, Mark Benjamin","2007","Agricultural & Environmental Science Collection","pro","PG","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"

"4","the influence of lateral hydrologic connectivity on fluvial flux and ecosystem metabolism in a river-floodplain system","r3_28","Ag_search_issue","Within mountainous watersheds and river networks, low-gradient valley bottoms can function as locations of high retention and biogeochemical processing. We evaluated hydrologic dynamics, nutrient flux, and aquatic ecosystem metabolism across the snowmelt hydrograph from May – October 2015 along two river segments of the North Saint Vrain Creek, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado: a valley-confined channel (confined segment) and an unconfined wet valley (unconfined segment) directly downstream. We observed significant differences in water, carbon, and nutrient flux, ecosystem metabolism, and lateral hydrologic connectivity dynamics among these contrasting segments. The confined segment was a consistent source of water, carbon, and nutrients and exported 14.4 mm of water, 26 g NO 3 -N ha -1 , 41 g dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) ha -1 , and 721 g dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ha -1 per 100 m of river length over the study period. In contrast, the unconfined segment exhibited variable source-sink dynamics and stored 1.2 g NO 3 -N ha -1 and 1.8 g DON ha -1 , and exported only 1.1 mm of water and 8 g DOC ha -1 per 100 m. The retention of water, DOC and N related to the strength of lateral connectivity between the river and the floodplain, which in turn, influenced fluvial ecosystem metabolism rates. Gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) rates were higher and more variable in the unconfined versus confined river segment; average GPP was +1.01 ± 0.76 g O 2 m -2 d -1 and ER was -1.77 ± 1.10 g O 2 m -2 d -1 in the unconfined segment, whereas average GPP was +0.09 ± 0.14 g O 2 m -2 d -1 and ER was -0.72 ± 0.50 g O 2 m -2 d -1 in the confined segment. We found that along the unconfined segment, metabolism rates generally increased from high to low flows and that the greatest increases occurred in a floodplain side-channel with intermittent surface water connections with the main channel. Combined, our data suggest a conceptual model where DOC and N are delivered to floodplain water-bodies via lateral hydrologic connections during high flows, and are subsequently utilized when velocities decline and processing rates are maximized.","Wegener, Pamela","2016","Agricultural & Environmental Science Collection","pro","PG","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"6","a floodplain-scale lake classification based on characteristics of macroinvertebrate assemblages and corresponding environmental properties","r3_01","June 30 search","Floodplain lakes have been experiencing great pressures by human activities, and ecological functionsin different types of lakes show different degrees of degradation. For facilitating conservation and management of different types of floodplain lakes, it is necessary to classify the lakes into similar groups according to certain standards. In this study, on basis of consideration of macroinvertebrate assemblages and corresponding environmental properties, the Yangtze floodplain lakes were classified into three major types grouping five groups of lakes: (1) river-disconnected lakes (algal lakes, macrophytic-algal transition lakes, and macrophytic lakes), (2) semi-connected lakes (oxbow lakes), (3) river-connected lakes. The classification of floodplain lakes mainly reflects the gradients of trophic and hydrological connectivity. The key factors structuring macroinvertebrate assemblages in the Yangtze floodplain lakes were mainly hydrological (connectivity rating, water depth), trophic (total phosphorus, macrophytes biomass) and morphometric (development of lake shoreline). Among the floodplain lakes, ecological status of river-connected lakes, where biodiversity, biomass and production of macroinvertebrates reached maxima, has been confirmed to be the best. From the view of conservation and management of the entire floodplain lakes, it is suggested that protecting the remnants of river-connected lakes, controlling eutrophication and linking disconnected lakes freely with the mainstream are crucial.","Pan, Baozhu;Wang, Hongzhu;Wang, Haijun","2014","ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts","chla","MB","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"10","a tracer-based simulation approach to quantify seasonal dynamics of surface-groundwater interactions in the pantanal wetland","r3_02","","The Pantanal wetland is one of the least explored regions of South America. It is characterized by an outstanding flora and fauna adapted to a seasonal flood pulse controlled by a dry and a wet season within each year. The resulting inundation covers in average an area of approximately 150000km super(2) and is seen as the most important driver for ecological integrity. Evaporation from the large floodplain is supposed to influence the climate of the whole continent. The regional groundwater is connected to the surface water and plays an important role for the characteristic flooding regime by regulating the wetland's water table. The water balance assessment of the wetland and the internal water exchange between surface and groundwater is therefore of high relevance for the conservation of the Pantanal biodiversity. Despite of its importance, water balance studies including groundwater-surface water interactions based on field data are rarely undertaken. This is mainly due to the remoteness and difficulty in accessing this area, which results in lack of data. In our study, we developed a new tracer-based model to simulate the spatio-temporal surface and subsurface fluxes for a range of water bodies. The model was able to simulate these fluxes considering a dynamic simulation of inflow and outflow using a newly collected 2-year dataset of water levels, stable water isotopes and chloride collected from several water bodies in the northern Pantanal region. Quantitative differences between water bodies according to their location in the floodplain were determined by the flooding regime and connectivity as well as site-specific characteristics, such as hydraulic conductivity and water depth. Our model simulated water balance fluxes with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.61, whereas it simulated stable water isotopic compositions better than chloride. We present the first study based on field data for the Pantanal, which is able to quantify water balances fluxes. Because their representation in global climate and land cover products is insufficient, our simulation results are valuable for validating large-scale models.","Schwerdtfeger, J;Hartmann, A;Weiler, M","2016","ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts","chla","PG","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"18","assessing seasonal eco-hydrological variability in lakes in the peace athabasca delta","r3_03","","It has been accepted previously that flood events brought about river ice-jam flooding plays a important role in the biology and maintenance of the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) lakes through recharge of water volume and supplying nutrients to maintain the high productivity of deltaic lakes. While such assumptions are not unreasonable, little research has been done to test this theory. Ten PAD lakes positioned along a gradient of Evaporation/Inflow ratio were examined during 2003 with the goal of studying how the hydrologic setting influences the limnology of such waterbodies. The following questions were asked in this study: 1) Does hydraulic connectivity affect the nutrient and/or light regimes of deltaic lakes? 2) Does hydraulic connectivity affect productivity of macrophyte and phytoplankton communities? 3) Does hydraulic connectivity alter the seasonality of the limno-ecology of PAD lakes? Progress towards answering these questions goals were achieved through work of the previous summer (2003). Continuation of this work in the coming summer (2004) will allow for an examination of inter-year variability. In particular the possibility of contrasting the effects of differing ice break-up conditions on the seasonal development of limnological physical, chemical and biological conditions.","Wiklund, JA;Hall, R I","1","ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts","pro","MB","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"27","changes in water chemistry associated with beaver-impounded coastal marshes of eastern georgian bay","r3_04","","Coastal marshes of eastern Georgian Bay contain unique water chemistry that reflects mixing between the relatively ion-rich waters of Georgian Bay and the relatively ion-poor water draining the Canadian Shield landscape. These unique chemical characteristics may be dramatically altered when wetlands become hydrologically disconnected from Georgian Bay through beaver activity. We sampled 35 coastal marshes in Georgian Bay, 17 of which had beaver impoundments built at the outlet of the coastal wetland. Impounded marshes had significantly higher total phosphorus (30.2 versus 15.3 mu g.L super(-1), p = 0.0015), soluble reactive phosphorus, (13.33 versus 3.7 mu g.L super(-1), p less than or equal to 0.0001), total suspended solids (15.5 versus 2.1 mg.L super(-1), p less than or equal to 0.0001), turbidity (5.4 versus 1.6, p = 0.0004), and chlorophyll (6.2 versus 1.9 mu g.L super(-1), p = 0.0004), but significantly lower pH (5.57 versus 6.95, p less than or equal to 0.0001), nitrates (0.03 versus 0.04 mg.L super(-1), p = 0.0416), and conductivity (47 versus 134 mu S.cm super(-1), p less than or equal to 0.0001), indicative of reduced mixing with Georgian Bay. The mosaic of chemical conditions and altered hydrological connectivity associated with beaver impoundments in coastal marshes of Georgian Bay may affect the distribution of other wetland biota, and further studies should be conducted to ascertain these impacts.Original Abstract: Les marais littoraux de l'est de la baie Georgienne presentent une chimie de l'eau particuliere qui reflete le melange d'eaux relativement riches en ions dans la baie Georgienne et de l'eau relativement pauvre en ions s'ecoulant du Bouclier.

"36","connectivity influences temporal variation of limnological conditions in missouri river scour lakes","r3_05","","Two scour lakes in the Missouri River floodplain were sampled 20 months (April 1996-December 1997) to examine effects of river inflow on mixing, seston, and nutrient dynamics. Lake NC-11 ( approximately 4 ha) is deep ( approximately 16 m), sheltered, dimictic, and connected to the river only during floods. Lake S-19 ( approximately 20 ha) comprises two sub-basins, a deep ( approximately 12 m) riverine forewater perennially connected to the river and a shallow ( approximately 4 m), polymictic backwater of variable connectivity. Stratification in NC-11 affected, and was affected by, river inputs - cool inflows mixed completely and sometimes destratified the lake, warmer inflows were partly or completely confined to the epilimnion. Mixing between basins at S-19 was incomplete except during floods. During floods, concentrations of seston and particulate N and P were similar in the two basins of S-19, but conditions in the two basins diverged substantially during inter-flood periods as lower water levels reduced lateral exchange. Seston concentrations in NC-11 during floods were much less ( approximately 90% less) than in S-19 or the river. In NC-11, algal blooms (chlorophyll 50-90 mu g times L super(-1)) occurred in summer post-flood periods, but larger blooms (chlorophyll 50-256 mu g times L super(-1)) occurred in the S-19 backwater during periods of low connectivity in all seasons. Nitrate-N peaked at >2 mg times L super(-1) during floods but was exhausted during algal blooms along with up to approximately 90% of dissolved phosphorus. Silica declined sharply (up to 93%) in many, but not all blooms, but remained >0.5 mg times L super(-1) in all observations. Connectivity influenced many lake features and enhanced nutrient availability, but other floodplain lakes lacking river connections have similar algal biomass.","Knowlton, M F;Jones, J R","2003","ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts","chla","MB","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"44","development of a high-resolution land cover product of the rocky mountains with application to carbon concentrations in its streams; assessing anthropogenic, climatological, and morphological contributions","r3_06","","In recent decades, the Rocky Mountain (RM) region has undergone significant changes associated with anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization and forest logging for agriculture, and natural disturbances, such as wildfires and bark beetle infestations. These changes have the potential to alter primary productivity and biomass carbon storage. Specifically, changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the RM streams are relevant because dissolved organic matter affects heterotrophic processes, acts as a source for the nutrient cycle, absorbs sunlight radiation, alters the transport of metals, and can promote the appearance of carcinogenic byproducts during water treatment. Specifically, recent studies have focused on the relationship between bark beetle infestations and stream organic matter, but have reached conflicting conclusions, possibly due to the small areas analyzed or an incomplete understanding of the processes that influence organic matter concentrations. Consequently, here we compile and process multiple datasets representing changes and features of the RM region for the period 1983-2012 with the purpose of assessing their relative influence on stream DOC concentrations. Land cover (LC) is especially important for modeling DOC. LC drives many environmental processes, so its assessment, monitoring, and characterization are essential. However, existing LC products each have different temporal and spatial resolutions and different LC classes and cannot be used for our goal of studying the large scale spatial-temporal variability of DOC. Here, we review the complexities of LC identification and propose a method for fusing multiple existing LC products to produce a single LC record for a large spatial-temporal grid, referred to as spatiotemporal categorical map fusion (SCaMF). We first reconcile the LC classes of different LC products and then present a probabilistic weighted nearest neighbor estimator of LC class. This estimator depends on three unknown parameters that are estimated using numerical optimization to maximize a user-defined agreement criterion. We illustrate the method using six LC products over the Rocky Mountains and show the improvement gained by supplying the optimization with data-driven information describing the spatial-temporal behavior of each LC class. Given the massive size of the LC products, we show how the optimal parameters for a given year are often optimal for other years, leading to shorter computing times. We implement the SCaMF methodology over a large region of the RM, encompassing sections of six states, to create a new LC product, SCaMF-RM. To do this, we adapt SCaMF to address the prediction of LC in large space-time regions that present nonstationarities, and we add more flexibility in the LC classifications of the predicted product. SCaMF-RM is produced at two high spatial resolutions, 30 and 50 m, and a yearly frequency for the 30-year period 1983-2012. When multiple products are available in time, we illustrate how SCaMF-RM captures relevant information from the different LC products and improves upon flaws in other products. Future work needed includes an exhaustive validation not only of SCaMF-RM but also of all input LC products. The features of the RM region for the period 1983-2012 representing possible influences on stream DOC concentrations are grouped in four categories: anthropogenic activities, forest disturbances, climate change, and the region's morphology, including LC. We analyze the significance of each of these features when predicting base-flow DOC concentrations in the RM streams, because base-flow concentrations are more representative of the longer-term (annual to decadal) impacts. To do this, we use a statistical model to account for the possible correlation among features and for the intrinsic connectivity and hydrologic directionality of a stream network. While natural forest disturbances are positively correlated with increased DOC concentrations, the effect of urbanization is far greater. Similarly, higher maximum temperatures, which can be exacerbated by climate change, are also associated with elevated DOC concentrations. Overall, DOC concentrations present an increasing trend over time in the RM region.","Rodriguez Jeangros, Nicolas","2018","GeoRef","pro","PG","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"56","effects of chloroplast–cytoplasm exchange and lateral mass transfer on slow induction of chlorophyll fluorescence in characeae","r3_07","","Rapid cytoplasmic streaming in characean algae mediates communications between remote cell regions exposed to uneven irradiance. The metabolites exported from brightly illuminated chloroplasts spread along the internode with the liquid flow and cause transient changes in chlorophyll fluorescence at cell areas that are exposed to dim light or placed shortly in darkness. The largest distance to which the photometabolites can be transported has not yet been determined. Neither is it known if lateral transport has an influence on the induction of chlorophyll fluorescence. In this study, the relations between spatial connectivity of anchored chloroplasts in characean internodes and fluorescence induction curves were examined. Connectivity between remote cell parts was pronounced upon illumination of a cell spot at a distance up to 10 mm from the area of fluorescence measurement, provided the spot was located upstream in the cytoplasmic flow. Spatial interactions between distant cell sites were also manifested in strikingly different slow stages of fluorescence induction caused by narrow‐ and wide‐field illumination. Cytochalasin D, cooling of bath solution, and inactivation of light‐dependent envelope transporters were used to disturb cyclosis‐mediated spatial interactions. Although fluorescence induction curves induced by narrow‐ and wide‐field illumination differed greatly under control conditions, they became similar after the inhibition of cyclosis with cytochalasin D. The results indicate that cytoplasmic streaming not only drives the lateral translocation of photometabolites but also promotes the export of reducing power from illuminated chloroplasts due to flushing the chloroplast surface and keeping sharp concentration gradients.","Bulychev, Alexander A;Cherkashin, Alexander A;Shapiguzov, Stepan Yu;Alova, Anna V","2021","Agricultural & Environmental Science Collection","chla","MB","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"74","hydrodynamic investigation of surface hydrological connectivity and its effects on the water quality of seasonal lakes: insights from a complex floodplain setting (poyang lake, china)","r3_08","","Small, seasonal lakes that exist in floodplains are rarely investigated, and yet they play an important role in the protection of biodiversity and are highly susceptible to modification due to human activities. This study presents a first attempt to combine hydrodynamic modeling and statistical methods to investigate hydrological connectivity and its relationship with the water quality of nine seasonal lakes within the floodplains of Poyang Lake (China). The hydrodynamic model reproduced reasonably well the hydrological regime of the lake and surrounding floodplains, based on field measurements and remote sensing data. Floodplain lakes exhibit similar water-level dynamics to the main lake during connected periods of flooding, while they decouple from the main lake during recession periods. Geostatistical results reveal that although the north-south hydrological connectivity extends over a longer pathway than the west-east connectivity, the rapid reduction in the west-east connectivity indicates a more sensitive response. The west-east connectivity tends to play a dominant role in affecting the interactions between the main lake and floodplains, as expected. Statistical methods indicate that surface hydrological connectivity across the floodplain results in an enhanced spatial similarity in the water quality of the floodplain lakes, in terms of a multitude of water quality parameters (TN, TP, NH4+-N, NO3−-N, NO2−-N, PO43−, CODMn, and Chl a), while surface hydrological isolation was observed to increase the water quality differences between the seasonal lakes. Additionally, enhanced hydrological connectivity may lead to improved water quality of the seasonal lakes from low connectivity to high connectivity condition. Hydrological connectivity may be a key factor controlling the dynamics in water quality between seasonal lakes. The findings of this study support the management of both Poyang Lake and the floodplain wetlands by providing important information on both water resource and water quality, and proposals to better manage the impacts of intensive human activities.","Li, Yunliang;Wu, Huawu;Yao, Jing;Zhang, Qi;Liu, Xinggen;Cai, Yongjiu;Tan, Zhiqiang","2019","Agricultural & Environmental Science Collection","chla","PG","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"100","integrated fracture characterization of asmari reservoir in haftkel field","r3_09","","The Asmari reservoir in Haftkel field is one of the most prolific naturally fractured reservoirs in the Zagros folded zone in the southwest of Iran. The primary production was commenced in 1928 and continued until 1976 with a plateau rate of 200,000 bbl/day for several years. There was an initial gas cap on the oil column. Gas injection was commenced in June 1976 and so far, 28% of the initial oil in place have been recovered. As far as we concerned, fracture network is a key factor in sustaining oil production; therefore, it needs to be characterized and results be deployed in designing new wells to sustain future production. Multidisciplinary fracture evaluation from well to reservoir scale is a great privilege to improve model’s accuracy as well as enhancing reliability of future development plan in an efficient manner. Fracture identification and modeling usually establish at well scale and translate to reservoir using analytical or numerical algorithms with the limited tie-points between wells. Evaluating fracture network from production data can significantly improve conventional workflow where limited inter-well information is available. By incorporating those evidences, the fracture modeling workflow can be optimized further where lateral and vertical connectivity is a concern. This paper begins with the fracture characterization whereby all available data are evaluated to determine fracture patterns and extension of fracture network across the field. As results, a consistent correlation is obtained between the temperature gradient and productivity of wells, also convection phenomenon is confirmed. The findings of this section help us in better understanding fracture network, hydrodynamic communication and variation of temperature. Fracture modeling is the next step where characteristics of fractures are determined according to the structural geology and stress directions. Also, the fault’s related fractures and density of fractures are determined. Meanwhile, the results of data evaluation are deployed into the fracture model to control distribution and characteristics of fracture network, thereby a better representation is obtained that can be used for evaluating production data and optimizing development plan.","Khadivi, Kourosh;Alinaghi, Mojtaba;Dehghani, Saeed;Soltani, Mehrbod;Hassani, Hamed;Mosavi, Seyed Chaseb;Shiralipour, Mansour;Fardin, Hashem;Sanjari, Sadegh;Partovi, Mohammad","2022","ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts","pro","MB","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"103","investigation of discharge-area groundwaters for recharge source characterization on different scales: the case of jinan in northern china","r3_10","","Discharge-area groundwater in Jinan, a typical karst region in northern China, was investigated by studying both the hydrological and chemical processes evolving from the recharge in mountainous terrains to the karst-spring outflows in the metropolitan area. Large-scale exploitation of karst groundwater has led to a disturbing trend in the ever-decreasing spring outflow rates and groundwater level. There is insufficient information about the Jinan karst aquifers, which provide the main water sources to meet human demand and to sustain spring outflow. The coupling of hydrological and chemical processes quantifies the flow system through aqueous chemistry characterization of the water sources. This approach is used to study the groundwater flow discharges in different locations and geological settings. The potentiometric data indicated limited vertical connectivity between distinct hydrogeological units and alteration of the recharge regime by the faults and by artificial exploitation. Shallow groundwater primarily belongs to the local flow system, with high nitrate concentration and enriched stable isotopic contents. Thermal groundwater has high concentrations of chloride and total dissolved solids, derived from a regional flow system with the highest recharge altitudes and long residence time. Non-thermal karst water may be attributed to the intermediate flow system, with uniform HCO sub(3)-Ca(Mg) facies and low nitrate concentration. This work highlighted discharge as a fingerprint of groundwater flow conditions and provides a better insight into the hydrogeological system.Original Abstract: L'eau souterraine de la zone de decharge de Jinan, une region karstique typique dans le nord de la Chine, a fait l'objet d'une recherche par le biais d'une etude conjointe des processus hydrologiques et chimiques qui se developpent de la zone de recharge dans les terrains de montagne jusqu'aux emergences de sources karstiques dans l'aire metropolitaine. L'exploitation a grande echelle de l'eau souterraine du karst a conduit a une tendance alarmante de diminution ininterrompue du debit des sources et du niveau piezometrique des eaux souterraines. Il n'y a une information insuffisante concernant les aquiferes karstiques de Jinan, qui constituent les ressources en eau principales pour repondre a la demande en eau potable et pour assurer le soutien du debit des sources. Le couplage des processus hydrologiques et chimiques quantifie le systeme d'ecoulement grace a la caracterisation de l'hydrochimie des ressources en eau. Cette approche est utilisee pour etudier la decharge de l'ecoulement d'eau souterraine dans des localisations et des contextes geologiques differents. Les donnees de charges hydrauliques ont indique une connectivite verticale limitee entre les unites hydrogeologiques distinctes et une perturbation du regime de recharge par les failles et par l'exploitation artificielle. Les eaux souterraines peu profondes relevent essentiellement du systeme d'ecoulement local, avec une concentration elevee en nitrate et un enrichissement en isotopes stables. L'eau souterraine thermale a des concentrations elevees en chlorures et en matieres dissoutes totales, provenant d'un systeme d'ecoulement regional avec des altitudes de recharge les plus elevees et de long temps de sejour. L'eau non-thermale du karst peut etre attribuee a un systeme d'ecoulement intermediaire, avec un facies uniforme de type HCO sub(3)-Ca(Mg) et une concentration faible en nitrate.

"106","landscape controls on thermokarst lake water fluxes between inuvik and tuktoyaktuk, northwest territories, canada","r3_11","","The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world, causing precipitation to shift from snowfall to rainfall, longer snow-free and ice-free summers, increased evapotranspiration, and permafrost thaw. It is necessary to understand how thermokarst lake water fluxes will react to these changes if we are to predict future greenhouse gas fluxes from lakes. Greenhouse gas fluxes from lakes are tied to the amount of lateral carbon delivery into the lake, the residence time of lake waters, and the temperature of lake waters, all of which are regulated by lake water fluxes and lake characteristics.

Greenhouse gas fluxes from lakes are tied to the amount of lateral carbon delivery into the lake, the residence time of lake waters, and the temperature of lake waters, all of which are regulated by lake water fluxes and lake characteristics. We measured lake water flux components at multiple spatial and temporal scales across the 5000 km (super 2) boreal-tundra transition zone between Inuvik and Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, Canada. Lake water flux components were measured at two adjacent thermokarst lakes with different ratios of lake area to catchment area (LACA), from 2017-2019. Also, stable water isotope samples were collected from March-September 2018 from approximately 100 lakes across 2000 km (super 2) . From these samples we estimated the ratio of evaporation to inflow, residence time, and the mixture of snowmelt and rainfall runoff in each lake. Catchments of all 7500 lakes in the region were delineated using a high-resolution digital elevation model in order to estimate their LACA, and evaluate connectivity between lakes.

"121","nutrient controls on phytoplankton composition and ecological function among hydrologically distinct habitats in the upper mississippi river ","r3_12","","The Upper Mississippi River (UMR) is a productive floodplain river with a complex lateral habitat array. Three habitats (main channel, flow-through backwater (moderately connected), and single-connection backwater (least connected)) in a typical UMR reach (Pool 8 near La Crosse, WI) representing a connectivity gradient (distance to main channel) were studied. Differential responses by species of phytoplankton to diverse habitat conditions promoted compositional differences among contrasting habitats. Increases in cyanobacterial blooms have raised awareness that nutrient factors may be important to UMR phytoplankton dynamics. Four main goals of my research were to identify: (1) present (1999-2004) spatiotemporal patterns in phytoplankton species composition and related nutrient regimes in UMR Pool 8, (2) which nutrients control algal production across habitat and phytoplankton assemblage type, (3) the effect of nutrient enrichment on phytoplankton composition, and (4) how nutrient enrichment affects the ecological function (N sub(2)-fixation) of bloom-forming cyanobacteria. Nutrient addition bioassays were conducted in situ to test effects of nutrient enrichment on phytoplankton. Multivariate analyses aided in the identification of multi-species differences over space and time. Results indicated that seasonal change and to a lesser extent habitat differences affected phytoplankton species composition and that phosphorus (P) was the nutrient that best explained compositional patterns. Bioassay experiments indicated that net phytoplankton production was often N-limited or co-limited by N and P but that P alone was important in the single-connection backwater. The flow-through backwater was limited most frequently and had the greatest degree of limitation overall. In general, the strongest responses to nutrient enrichment by UMR phytoplankton occurred in response to NP-enrichment and resulted in greater species diversity. Often the addition of N alone or in combination with P resulted in lower cell densities and/or relative abundance of N sub(2)-fixing cyanobacteria, while non-N sub(2)-fixing cyanobacteria and chlorophytes responded positively to N and NP enrichment. Iron was found to be a factor determining cyanobacterial species composition. N sub(2)-fixation was found to supplement cyanobacterial N-requirements in single-connection and main channel habitats and was controlled by P supply. Management programs are going to need to account for the complex spatiotemporal dynamics between phytoplankton and nutrient supply identified in this study.","Decker, Jillian Kate","2012","ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts","chla","PG","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"123","opposing effects of climate and permafrost thaw on ch (sub 4) and co (sub 2) emissions from northern lakes","r3_13","","Small, organic-rich lakes are important sources of methane (CH (sub 4) ) and carbon dioxide (CO (sub 2) ) to the atmosphere, yet the sensitivity of emissions to climate warming is poorly constrained and potentially influenced by permafrost thaw. Here, we monitored emissions from 20 peatland lakes across a 1,600 km permafrost transect in boreal western Canada. Contrary to expectations, we observed a shift from source to sink of CO (sub 2) for lakes warmer regions, driven by greater primary productivity associated with greater hydrological connectivity to lakes and nutrient availability in the absence of permafrost. Conversely, an 8-fold increase in CH (sub 4) emissions in warmer regions was associated with water temperature and shifts in microbial communities and dominant anaerobic processes. Our results suggest that the net radiative forcing from altered greenhouse gas emissions of northern peatland lakes this century will be dominated by increasing CH (sub 4) emissions and only partially offset by reduced CO (sub 2) emissions.

"128","phytoplankton assemblages in a reservoir cascade of a large tropical - subtropical river (se, brazil)","r3_14","","The phytoplankton assemblages from eight reservoirs of the Paranapanema River were studied during two consecutive years. Chlorophyceae and Bacillaryophyceae dominated in richness. The observed high number of taxa, 234, reflects the extensive sampling programme and evidences the necessity of considering the whole hydrograph basin to assess the biodiversity status of inland water ecosystems. The dams had a negative effect on phytoplankton richness, with higher number of taxa associate to riverine (non-regulated) stretches. The tributary rivers also exhibited high species richness, showing the importance of considering the lateral dimension, in addition to the longitudinal one, for aquatic biota inventories in large river basins/reservoirs. Richness and diversity were also positively influenced by the connectivity with lateral wetlands (macrophyte-dominated lakes) due to the periphyton influence. The phytoplankton abundance/biomass was not influenced by higher water retention time. Higher values occurred in the middle basin stretches (river-passage reservoirs) due to the increase in the trophic conditions. There was a positive correlation with phosphorus. Poorer light conditions in the cascade do not limit the phytoplankton biomass, with assemblages dominated by species tolerant to turbulent conditions and high mineral turbidity. Bacillariophyceae and Cryptophyceae dominated numerically. The first group (unicellular forms) was prominent in the large and oligotrophic upstream reservoirs. The second was highly abundant in the river-passage (low retention time), and more eutrophic, reservoirs. Cyanophyceae growth is probably controlled by advection processes (wash-out effect). The zooplankton does not control the phytoplankton biomass and the diversity of both groups is positively associated in the cascade. The structure of the phytoplankton assemblages showed to be a good indicator of the operationally distinct reservoirs of the Paranapanema cascade and also reflected the changes in the trophic conditions along the basin.Original Abstract: As assembleias fitoplanctonicas de oito reservatorios do rio Paranapanema foram estudadas durante dois anos consecutivos. Chlorophyceae e Bacillaryophyceae foram os grapos dominantes em riqueza. O elevado numero de taxons observado, 234, reflete o extensivo programa de amostragem e evidencia a necessidade de se considerar a bacia hidrografica como um todo em programas de avaliacao da biodiversidade de ecossistemas aquaticos interiores. As barragens tiveram um efeito negativo sobre a riqueza do fitoplancton, sendo o maior numero de taxons associado aos trechos fluviais (nao regulados). Os rios tributarios tambem exibiram um elevado numero de especies, mostrando a importancia de se considerar a dimensao lateral, alem do gradiente longitudinal, para os inventarios da biota aquatica em reservatorios e bacias hidrograficas de grande porte. A riqueza e a diversidade tambem foram positivamente influenciadas pela conectividade com areas laterals inundaveis - varzeas dominadas pela presenga de macrofitas aquaticas, devido a contribuicao do perifiton. A abundancia e biomassa do fitoplancton nao foram influenciadas pelo tempo de retencao da agua nos reservatorios. Valores mais elevados foram observados no medio Paranapanema (reservatorios fio d'agua) devido ao aumento nas condicoes de trofia. Houve uma correlacao positiva com a concentracao de fosforo. Condicoes de menor transparencia nao limitaram a biomassa fitoplanctonica, sendo as assembleias dominadas por especies tolerantes a condicoes de elevada turbulencia e turbidez mineral.

"131","phytoplankton functional groups in a subtropical brazilian reservoir: responses to impoundment","r3_15","","The discontinuity in rivers caused by the construction of reservoirs disrupts the longitudinal gradient and decreases the natural connectivity of lotic systems. We evaluated the dynamics of Reynolds functional groups (RFGs) in response to the formation of a subtropical reservoir, in relation to the environmental changes between the pre- and post-impoundment periods. We hypothesized that the disruption of longitudinal connectivity and the changes in the light and mixing regime after the impoundment would directly influence the phytoplankton functional structure. Significant changes in the light and mixing regimes were observed after the impoundment, with the formation of a lacustrine zone, influencing the dynamics of RFGs. Fourteen RFGs were recorded. RFG C (diatoms) dominated in the pre-impoundment period. In the post-impoundment period, RFGs C, P (diatoms), and J (chlorophyceans) codominated with the highest mean values of biovolume. RFGs MP, N, H1, W2, F, E, A, W1, B, X1, and S1 contributed relatively little to the biovolume, although with higher values in the post-impoundment period. RFGs F and S1 were recorded only after the impoundment. This study revealed the important roles of physical processes and nutrients in the spatial and seasonal gradient, and in the selection of phytoplankton functional groups in a subtropical reservoir.","Souza, Dayane Garcia;Bueno, Norma Catarina;Bortolini, Jascieli Carla;Rodrigues, Luzia Cleide;Bovo-Scomparin, Vania Mara;Souza Franco, Gilza Maria","2016","ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts","chla","MB","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"132","phytoplankton of the middle parana river during an anomalous hydrological period: a morphological and functional approach","r3_16","","The Parana River mainstem was sampled monthly (November 1999-December 2000) in order to analyse phytoplankton structure and dynamics during a period of extreme low water discharge. Physiognomic groups, size fractions, taxonomic groups, species and Reynolds et al. [2002, Journal of Plankton Research, 24: 417-428] functional groups were studied in relation to environmental variables. The phytoplankton comprised an unusual development of small unicellular flagellates (1-20 mm), whereas large size algae such as the commonly recorded Aulacoseira were present with very low abundances. Groups Y (Cryptomonas spp.), X2 (Chlamydomonas spp., Rhodomonas minuta followed by a silicean chrysophyte) and D (Skeletonema cf. subsalsum and small centrics in minor proportion) dominated the phytoplankton community. Groups X2 and Y dominated at drought phase (November-December 1999). During the coupling of increasing waters and high-suspended solids (February-May 2000) minimum abundance was exhibited. The highest densities were registered during mid-waters (Y, D, X2) when a constant river-floodplain feedback occurred (September-December). The connectivity between the main channel and its alluvial valley, and their interaction resulting from the regular alternation of hydrological fluctuations, play a steering role in structuring the potamoplankton of large rivers. The multivariate RDA showed that water discharge and transparency highly explained a significant proportion of the functional groups variation. The functional classification is proposed as a useful approach in reconstructing the phytoplankton community. The differences in structure from the typically described potamoplankton for the Parana were maintained throughout the study period. The perseverance of the community changes that occurred during the drought depends, in part, on the persistence and magnitude of this anomalous phase.","Devercelli, Melina","2006","ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts","chla","PG","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"147","solute transport dynamics in small, shallow groundwater-dominated agricultural catchments: insights from a high-frequency, multisolute 10 yr-long monitoring study","r3_17","","High-frequency, long-term and multisolute measurements are required to assess the impact of human pressures on water quality due to (i) the high temporal and spatial variability of climate and human activity and (ii) the fact that chemical solutes combine short- and long-term dynamics. Such data series are scarce. This study, based on an original and unpublished time series from the Kervidy-Naizin headwater catchment (Brittany, France), aims to determine solute transfer processes and dynamics that characterise this strongly human-impacted catchment. The Kervidy-Naizin catchment is a temperate, intensive agricultural catchment, hydrologically controlled by shallow groundwater. Over 10 yr, five solutes (nitrate, sulphate, chloride, and dissolved organic and inorganic carbon) were monitored daily at the catchment outlet and roughly every four months in the shallow groundwater. The concentrations of all five solutes showed seasonal variations but the patterns of the variations differed from one solute to another. Nitrate and chloride exhibit rather smooth variations. In contrast, sulphate as well as organic and inorganic carbon is dominated by flood flushes. The observed nitrate and chloride patterns are typical of an intensive agricultural catchment hydrologically controlled by shallow groundwater. Nitrate and chloride originating mainly from organic fertilisers accumulated over several years in the shallow groundwater. They are seasonally exported when upland groundwater connects with the stream during the wet season. Conversely, sulphate as well as organic and inorganic carbon patterns are not specific to agricultural catchments. These solutes do not come from fertilisers and do not accumulate in soil or shallow groundwater; instead, they are biogeochemically produced in the catchment. The results allowed development of a generic classification system based on the specific temporal patterns and source locations of each solute. It also considers the stocking period and the dominant process that limits transport to the stream, i.e. the connectivity of the stocking compartment. This mechanistic classification can be applied to any chemical solute to help assess its origin, storage or production location and transfer mechanism in similar catchments.","Aubert, AH;Gascuel-Odoux, C;Gruau, G;Akkal, N;Faucheux, M;Fauvel, Y;Grimaldi, C;Hamon, Y;Jaffrezic, A;Lecoz-Boutnik, M","2013","ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts","chla","MB","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"148","spatial and temporal dynamics of suspended particle characteristics and composition in navigation pool 19 of the upper mississippi river","r3_18","","Suspended particles are an essential component of large rivers influencing channel geomorphology, biogeochemical cycling of nutrients, and food web resources. The Upper Mississippi River is a large floodplain river that exhibits pronounced spatiotemporal variation in environmental conditions and biota, providing an ideal environment for investigating dynamics of suspended particles in large river ecosystems. Here we investigated two questions: (i) How do suspended particle characteristics (e.g. size and morphology) vary temporally and spatially? and (ii) What environmental variables have the strongest association with particle characteristics? Water sampling was conducted in June, August, and September of 2013 and 2014 in Navigation Pool 19 of the Upper Mississippi River. A FlowCAM® (Flow Cytometer and Microscope) particle imaging system was used to enumerate and measure particles 53-300 µm in diameter for size and shape characteristics (e.g. volume, elongation, and symmetry). Suspended particle characteristics varied considerably over space and time and were strongly associated with discharge and concentrations of nitrate + nitrite (NO(3) ) and soluble reactive phosphorus. Particle characteristics in backwaters were distinct from those in other habitats for most of the study period, likely due to reduced hydrologic connectivity and higher biotic production in backwaters. During low discharge, phytoplankton and zooplankton made up relatively greater proportions of the observed particles. Concurrently during low discharge, concentrations of chlorophyll, volatile suspended solids, and total phosphorus were higher. Our results suggest that there are complex interactions among space, time, discharge, and other environmental variables (e.g. water nutrients), which drive suspended particle dynamics in large rivers.

"154","spatial variability in dissolved organic matter and inorganic nitrogen concentrations in a semiarid stream, san pedro river, arizona","r3_19","","We performed synoptic sampling of a 95-km reach of the San Pedro River, Arizona, to identify the effects of regional hydrology and land use on dissolved carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Six synoptic surveys, two before, two during, and two after the 2002 monsoon season, encompassed periods of both low and high stream discharge. Chloride concentrations and delta super(18)O values during low-flow periods indicated the river was divided into three hydrologically distinct reaches each roughly 30 km long. Upper and lower reaches were characterized by areas of localized groundwater input followed by downstream evapo-concentration gradients, limited downstream solute transport, and highly variable carbon and nitrogen concentrations. In contrast, the middle reach was characterized by widespread groundwater input, continuous downstream hydrologic connectivity, and less variable carbon and nitrogen concentrations. During the monsoon season, base flow discharge increased five- to ten-fold, dissolved organic matter and inorganic N increased two- to ten-fold, Fluorescence Index (FI) values indicated a large input of terrestrial solutes, and both chloride concentrations and delta super(18)O values indicated that stream water and alluvial groundwater were well mixed along the entire 95 km reach. Concurrently, the middle reach that exhibited continuous hydrologic connectivity during the nonmonsoon season was a net sink for N, while the reaches characterized by limited hydrologic connectivity during the low-flow season exhibited net N export. Our data suggest that instream biogeochemical cycling during the monsoon season is influenced by antecedent conditions, specifically hydrologic connectivity, during the dry season.","Brooks, Paul D;Lemon, Michelle M","2007","ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts","chla","MB","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"168","the main target of connection of lakes with rivers is not to dilute pollutants, but to rehabilitate natural hydrological regimes and self-purification function","r3_20","","Water diversion from rivers to lakes is popularly considered as a measure to control lake eutrophication, but the actual efficacy is quite limited in general. How to connect lakes with rivers in a scientific way? To answer this question, first, I analyze 5 diversion cases in China and other countries, and simulate effect of adding water using Vollen-weider's model. The results show that improving water quality by dilution depends upon whether there is large amount of input water with total phosphorus concentrations much lower than original inflow ones, but such a premise is generally difficult to meet. Second, I compare water quality of lakes disconnected and connected with the Yangtze mainstem, and find that chlorophyl a concentration of water in disconnected lakes are increased by 0.7-2.4 times when total phosphorus concentrations are in the same levels. The mechanisms of better water quality of connected lakes are fourfold, i.e., the natural water level fluctuation promotes vegetation development, seasonal trying-up and shallowing of lakeshore promotes pollutants decomposition and adsorption, turbid flowing water results in lower efficiency of nutrient utilization by phytoplankton, and the ecological complexity is higher with more heterogeneous habitats, higher biodiversity, and more complex food webs. Last, I point out that setting a scientific feasible target is the very basis to implement a river-lake connection project correctly. If the aim is to dilute pollutants, enough clean water is needed, and this can only be realized for smaller waterbodies. If the aim is to wash out phytoplankton, the flushing rate should be higher than specific growth rates of dominated algae, reaching 10%-20%/d, and this is also only feasible for smaller waterbodies. As for most lakes, in particular, shallow ones, connection of lakes with rivers should aim mainly to rehabilitate free hydrological connectivity and natural water level regimes, and then to enhance self-purification function. Such a mode costs a lesser amount of water, but reaches the best effect. This review provides important guidance for river-lake connection projects.","Wang Hong-Zhu","2021","BiosisPreview","chla","PG","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"170","the production processes and characteristics of nitrogen pollution in bare sloping farmland in a karst region","r3_21","","Nitrogen loss in karst sloping farmland will lead to declining land productivity and environmental pollution, in which the nitrogen loss through underground pore fissures will directly lead to groundwater pollution. The characteristics of total nitrogen (TN) production were studied by simulating the ""dual structure"" microenvironment of sloping farmland in a karst region using an artificial rainfall simulation method. The results show that rainfall was the main driving factor of TN loss in karst sloping farmland. TN was mainly lost through underground pore fissures when the rainfall intensity was ≤ 30 mm · h-1. TN was lost at the surface and underground when the rainfall intensity was ≥ 50 mm · h-1, TN loss on the surface accounted for a large proportion, and the surface flow was the main carrier of TN loss. The TN loss underground is easily ignored because it is hidden underground. Therefore, TN loss belowground in karst sloping farmland should receive increased attention. It would be interesting to explore the influences of connectivity and type of underground pore fissure system on TN loss in karst sloping farmland. The prevention and control of TN loss in karst sloping farmland should be considered both at the surface and underground. Reducing the formation of slope flows and slowing rainwater filtration by increasing slope vegetation coverage can be considered to reduce TN loss. The results of this study provide a theoretical reference for agricultural non-point source pollution control in a karst region.

"181","trophic gradients in a large-river delta: ecological structure determined by connectivity gradients in the danube delta (romania)","r3_22","","There are over 300 lakes interconnected by riverbranches and man-made canals in the Danube Delta (Romania). A multidisciplinary survey of these riverine lakes situated in large wetland complexes was made comprising hydrological modelling, remote sensing and monitoring of water quality, plankton, aquatic vegetation and fish communities. Between-lake differences in water quality and aquatic vegetation cover were inferred from satellite image. Based on channel and lake dimensions, hydrological characteristics of the lakes in the delta were determined: hydrological distance from a riverbranch, residence time and impact of reed water. Water-quality and biotic parameters (phyto- and zooplankton, submerged plants and fish) were sampled in a comparative survey in June 1997-1999 in subsets of the lakes. In a follow-up study in 2001-2002, seasonality of aquatic vegetation and fish were recorded. A clear distinction was found in three lake types: (1) inflow lakes at short distance to the river, with a high flushing rate, high load of suspended minerals but low chlorophyll concentrations, high cover of floating and submerged vegetation and dominance of eurytopic fish; (2) large, relatively deep lakes with moderately long residence time, high Potamogeton-cover that collapses during summer, and dominated by eurytopic fish; (3) smaller, isolated lakes at the longest distance from the river, with long residence time, of which the water quality is strongly influenced by water flows through large floating reedbeds (blackwater), with a high vegetation cover of Ceratophyllum demersum and Nitellopsis obtusa throughout the summer and a limnophilic fish community tolerant for low oxygen conditions. Aquatic vegetation showed a clear seasonality related to the interaction between plant development and light conditions. Seasonal changes in fish distribution within the system merely followed the vegetation trends in different lakes and the conditions in the river channels. Past trends in the trophic gradient are discussed in the context of hydromorphological modifications in the Delta. There is a high potential for restoring natural processes owing to the high connectivity and large scale of the system.","Coops, Hugo;Buijse, Laura L;Buijse, Anthonie D;Constantinescu, Adrian;Covaliov, Silviu;Hanganu, Jenica;Ibelings, Bas W;Menting, Geert;Navodaru, Ion;Oosterberg, Willem;Staras, Mircea;Torok, Liliana","2008","ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts","chla","PG","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
"183","trophic status of missouri river floodplain lakes in relation to basin type and connectivity","r3_23","","Limnological data were collected over a two-year period from 12 lakes in the Missouri River floodplain in order to evaluate lake trophic status and the influence of basin type and connectivity on nutrient, seston, and phytoplankton dynamics. The lakes were located in west-central Missouri and included eight scour basins formed by levee breaks during a 1993 flood and four older oxbow lakes. The Missouri River was also sampled. Five of the scour basins (connected scours) were inundated by the Missouri River for varying periods during the study. The other lakes (protected lakes) were hydrologically isolated from the river by levees. On the basis of mean total phosphorus (TP - 61-282 mu g/L), mean total nitrogen (TN - 0.7-2.1 mg/L), mean chlorophyll (CHL - 22-67 mu g/L), and mean suspended solids (TSS - 16-93 mg/L), all 12 sites were highly eutrophic compared to other lakes in Missouri. Nutrient fractions and seston composition indicated dominance of inorganic nutrients and abiotic seston in the riverine lakes. Maximum concentrations of nutrients and TSS occurred in oxbow lakes during periods of sediment resuspension and in connected scours during floods in spring 1995 and 1996 when connected sites were inundated by the Missouri River. Algal blooms with peak CHL >200 mu g/L occurred sporadically in the oxbow lakes. Similarly large blooms (peak CHL 81-689 mu g/L) occurred in connected scours when low river levels reduced exchange with the river. Reduced connectivity was accompanied by rapid loss of dissolved N and P fractions, especially nitrate. Protected scours had lower average TP, TN, and TSS than the other sites and were less temporally variable.","Knowlton, M F;Jones, J R","1997","ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts","chla","MB","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"

Primary and secondary data on pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, temperature, Secchi depth (SD), and nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations were utilized in the present study. The results indicated Secchi depth and chlorophyll-a were the most erratic of all the analyzed environmental variables studied, exhibiting a range of 0.69 +/- 0.29-0.87 +/- 0.34 m and 9.03 +/- 0.81-34.97 +/- 3.36 mu g/L respectively. Two-way ANOVA yielded no significant interactions between sampling sites and seasons for all the variables. Except chlorophyll-a, there also were no significant differences among the sampling sites for the studied variables. Seasonality yielded significant differences for Secchi depth, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a. The Carlson Trophic Index for Chl-a and SD indicated Lake Kanyaboli is currently eutrophic, while the TP concentration indicated hypereutrophic conditions. The lake, however, has fluctuated between eutrophic and hypereutrophic conditions over the past years. Although historical water quality data for the lake is scanty and infrequent, most physical and chemical variables reflected anthropogenic effects on a temporal scale. Interestingly, despite its eutrophic status, the general lake condition is still relatively good, attributable to the buffering effect from the extensive macrophytes fringing it. The present study identified nutrient loading, wetland reclamation and connectivity with the Yala River through a feeder canal as the management issues of critical concern. Accordingly continuous monitoring of the lake's water quality to detect anthropogenic effects is recommended for management intervention purposes.","Kondowe, Benjamin N.; Masese, Frank O.; Raburu, Philip O.; Singini, Wales; Walumona, Riziki Jacques","2022","BiosisPreview","chla","PG","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
