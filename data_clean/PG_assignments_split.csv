"complex hydroperiod induced carryover responses for survival, growth, and endurance of a pond-breeding amphibian","Assessing carryover effects from the aquatic to the terrestrial stage of pond-breeding amphibians is critical as temperature and hydrologic regimes of temporary ponds continue to be altered as a result of climate change and other stressors. We evaluated carryover effects of hydroperiod length (50-62 days) on amphibian survival, developmental rates, and locomotor performance using a model organism, the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), through aquatic and terrestrial mesocosm experiments with individual tests of locomotor performance. We found that shorter hydroperiods (50 days) had low larval survival (0.44 ± 0.03) compared to the 62-day hydroperiod (0.91 ± 0.09) and increased developmental rates, resulting in smaller sizes at metamorphosis. We did not find evidence of carryover effects on terrestrial survival three months post-metamorphosis with all hydroperiod treatments showing high terrestrial survival (0.88 ± 0.07). However, post-metamorphic frogs from the longer hydroperiod treatments grew faster and larger compared to individuals from shortest hydroperiods and performed significantly better during endurance trials at 18 °C. Disentangling complex carryover effects across multiple life stages in species with high phenotypic plasticity can shed light on the physiological capacity of species to respond to changing environments and inform mechanistic predictions of persistence in the face of anthropogenic stressors.","Thompson, Cassandra M;Popescu, Viorel D",Scholarly Journals,2021,195,2494302612,proquest,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
patterns of fish communities and water quality in impounded lakes of china's south-to-north water diversion project,"Understanding the ecological impacts of large-scale hydraulic projects is critical for maintaining ecosystem health while meeting human water needs. It is, however, currently hindered by a lack of direct evidence on ecological impacts associated with this type of project particularly on water quality and fish communities. Here, we characterized patterns and variations of fish communities and water quality in five impounded lakes of the Chinese South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), with the aim of better understanding potential ecological impacts of inter-basin water transfers. We found that 1) the impacts of water transfer on water quality in the impounded lakes was generally characterized by hydrological parameters (e.g. total suspended solids, turbidity, transparency, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and total hardness) in an upstream-downstream direction; 2) increased hydrological connectivity may have favored biological invasion (e.g. Tridentiger bifasciatus) and promoted a potential biotic homogenization among the impounded lakes; and 3) there was a pattern of decreased fish abundance and biomass from the upstream to downstream lakes with fish communities strongly driven by changing water quality patterns across the impounded lakes. These findings improve our understanding of ecological impacts of large-scale hydraulic projects and provide a significant basis for water agencies with similar water transfer systems to optimize their water transfer management in order to minimize ecological impacts.","Guo, Chuanbo;Chen, Yushun;Gozlan, Rodolphe E;Liu, Han;Lu, Ying;Qu, Xiao;Wang, Lizhu;Xia, Wentong;Xie, Songguang;Xiong, Fangyuan",Scholarly Journals,2020,713,2388744981,proquest,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
immigration and early life stages recruitment of the european flounder (platichthys flesus) to an estuarine nursery: the influence of environmental factors,"Connectivity between coastal spawning grounds and estuarine nurseries is a critical step in the life cycle of many fish species. Larval immigration and transport-associated physical–biological processes are determinants of recruitment success to nursery areas. The recruitment of the European flounder, Platichthys flesus, to estuarine nurseries located at the southern edge of the species distribution range, has been usually investigated during its juvenile stages, while estuarine recruitment during the earlier planktonic life stage remains largely unstudied. The present study investigated the patterns of flounder larval recruitment and the influence of environmental factors on the immigration of the early life stages to the Lima estuary (NW Portugal), integrating data on fish larvae and post-settlement individuals (&lt;50mm length), collected over 7years. Late-stage larvae arrived at the estuary between February and July and peak abundances were observed in April. Post-settlement individuals (&lt;50mm) occurred later between April and October, whereas newly-settled ones (&lt;20mm) were found only in May and June. Variables associated with the spawning, survival and growth of larvae in the ocean (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a and inland hydrological variables) were the major drivers of flounder occurrence in the estuarine nursery. Although the adjacent coastal area is characterized by a current system with strong seasonality and mesoscale variability, we did not identify any influence of variables related with physical processes (currents and upwelling) on the occurrence of early life stages in the estuary. A wider knowledge on the influence of the coastal circulation variability and its associated effects upon ocean-estuarine connectivity is required to improve our understanding of the population dynamics of marine spawning fish that use estuarine nurseries.","Amorim, Eva;Bordalo, Adriano A;Elliott, Michael;Ramos, Sandra",Scholarly Journals,2016,107,2000151948,proquest,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
hydrological connectivity and basin morphometry influence seasonal water-chemistry variations in tundra ponds of the northwestern hudson bay lowlands,"Due to shallow depth and high surface area-to-volume ratio, ponds of the Hudson Bay Lowlands are vulnerable to climatic and hydrological changes, but relations between hydrological processes and limnological conditions remain unknown. Here, we measured water balance and limnological variables (water chemistry, suspended sediments, chlorophyll-a) at 20 ponds near Churchill (Manitoba) three times during the ice-free season of 2010 to explore relations among hydrological connectivity, basin morphometry, and water chemistry variations. Using principal components analysis, we identified that the ponds followed one of four distinctive ""seasonal water chemistry trajectories"" (SWCT1-4). Most of the ponds that lacked apparent hydrologic connectivity displayed SWCT1, characterized by rising alkalinity and ionic content between early June and late July due to evaporative concentration. In contrast, most ponds with apparent hydrological connectivity displayed SWCT2 or SWCT3, characterized by marked changes in suspended sediment and total nitrogen concentrations due to inflow that transferred allochthonous materials from the catchment. Ponds in SWCT2 likely possessed temporary hydrological connections during periods of relatively high water supply and exhibited marked decline of suspended sediment and total nitrogen content when hydrological connection was lost. Most ponds in SWCT3 maintained active hydrological connections during all or most of the ice-free season and possessed relatively high suspended sediment and total nitrogen concentrations throughout the season. Ponds in SWCT4 possessed relatively stable water chemistry due to greater water depth and local features that reduced wind-induced sediment resuspension. We conclude that hydrological connectivity and basin morphometry exert important influence on seasonal pond water-chemistry dynamics.","White, Jerry;Hall, Roland I;Wolfe, Brent B;Light, Erin M;Macrae, Merrin L;Fishback, LeeAnn;Keller, Wendel;Paterson, Andrew M;Ruehland, Kathleen M;Blais, Jules M",Scholarly Journals,2014,46,2367028852,proquest,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
functional indicators of stream health: a river-basin approach,"Summary1. The efficacy of leaf-litter decomposition, sediment respiration, biofilm biomass, growth, chlorophyll a concentration and the autotrophic index (biofilm ash-free dry mass-chlorophyll a) and fungal biomass for detecting human-induced change was evaluated using 24 references and 15 disturbed stream sites located in central Portugal.2. Decomposition rates of alder (Alnus glutinosa) and oak (Quercus robur) leaves and sediment respiration rates were effective in discriminating impairment. Decomposition was negatively correlated with abiotic factors, such as ammonium and nitrite concentrations, connectivity and alterations in the hydrological regime, and positively correlated with nitrate concentration and oxygen concentration. Sediment respiration rates were correlated with organic contamination, land use and morphological changes.3. Growth rates of biofilm, concentration of chlorophyll a and the autotrophic index, although 41-73% higher at disturbed compared to reference sites, were not significantly different. These three variables were significantly correlated with total organic carbon, oxygen concentration, pH, nitrite and the presence of dams. Fungal biomass on leaves and biofilm biomass on natural substrata did not differ between reference and disturbed sites.4. Our findings lend support to the use of functional variables like decomposition and sediment respiration in monitoring and when used together with structural variables should give a more holistic measure of stream health.","FEIO, MJ;Alves, T;BOAVIDA, M;Medeiros, A;Graca, Mas",Scholarly Journals,2010,55,746081344,proquest,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
hydrological seasonality and benthic algal biomass in a neotropical floodplain river,"Our study evaluated spatiotemporal variation of physicochemical parameters and benthic and sestonic algal biomass in littoral areas of the main channel and floodplain lakes of the Cinaruco River, a lowland tributary of the Orinoco River in Venezuela. The Cinaruco is characterized by a highly predictable annual flood pulse, high transparency, and extremely low conductivity and suspended sediment load. During 2002 and 2003, 10 sites in the main channel and floodplain lagoons were sampled on 12 occasions. Correspondence analysis based on water physicochemical variables and algal biomass showed that (similar to)80% of the variation in the multivariate space among sites and sampling dates was explained by 2 axes. During the high-water periods, river and lagoon sites showed high similarity in water variables and algal biomass. Conductivity, SiO 3 , and chlorophyll a concentrations (both benthic and sestonic) were low during the high-water phase. On the other hand, water variables and algal biomass differed between river and lagoon sites during the low-water period. The absence of flow in lagoons and consistently low algal biomass (sestonic and benthic) in river sites were the most important features of the spatial variability between main channel and lagoon sites during low-water phases. Benthic chlorophyll a was highly uniform at small spatial scales and significantly heterogeneous at large spatial scales. The annual flood regime of the Cinaruco, which drives the concentrations of dissolved materials and affects material interchanges between aquatic and terrestrial systems, also appears to be responsible for creating strong patterns of seasonal and spatial variation in benthic algal crops.

"contrasts between channels and backwaters in a large, floodplain river: testing our understanding of nutrient cycling, phytoplankton abundance, and suspended solids dynamics","In floodplain rivers, variability in hydraulic connectivity interacts with biogeochemistry to determine the distribution of suspended and dissolved substances. Nutrient, chlorophyll a, and suspended solids data spanning longitudinal (5 study reaches across 1300 river km), lateral (main channel and backwaters), and temporal (1994-2011) gradients in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) were used to examine the extent to which observed differences between the main channel and backwaters were consistent with expectations based on current understanding of biogeochemical processes in large rivers. For N and P, the results largely conformed to expectations. N concentrations were greater in the main channel than in the backwaters in 82 to 96% of the observations across river reaches. Maximum TP concentrations generally occurred in backwaters during summer, when backwater TP often exceeded that of the main channel. Flux of P from sediments may be a substantial source of water-column P in UMR backwaters in summer. The data for suspended solids and chlorophyll a suggest that some refinements are needed of our understanding of ecosystem processes in large rivers. During low-discharge conditions, concentrations of inorganic suspended solids often were greater in backwaters than in the main channel, suggesting the importance of sediment resuspension. Chlorophyll a concentrations were usually greater in backwaters than in the main channel, but exceptions indicate that phytoplankton abundance in the main channel of the UMR can sometimes be greater than is typically expected for large rivers.","Houser, Jeffrey N.",Scholarly Journals,2016,35,BIOSIS:PREV201600572060,wos,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
intra-annual variation of chlorophyll-a and nutrients in a hydraulically perturbed river-floodplain system in the grijalva river basin,"Background: The lateral connectivity in the Maluco river-floodplain system was partially reduced by the highway built on a natural barrier. Goal: To determine if the concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and nutrients contrast in different water levels (WL) during a hydrologic year in the Maluco river-floodplain system. Methods: The WL, Chl-a, and nutrients (NO2-, NO3-, NH(4)(+)and TP) were simultaneously measured six times in two sites during two years. The expected differences of Chl-a and nutrients concentrations, related to the intra-annual fluctuation of the WL, were tested through multivariate techniques. The hypothesis holds that there will be no intra-annual differences of Chl-a and nutrients due to the reduction of lateral interconnection by the physical effect of the embankment. Results: No variable was discarded during PCA. The intra-annual distribution of samples was similar according to the similarity profile routine. Furthermore: 1) more than 54% of the Chl-a and TP values indicated hypereutrophic conditions throughout the year, and 2) none of the values of WL surpassed the height of the bankfull (4.5 mast). The maximum concentrations of Chl-a were registered at the minimum WL values. Conclusions: The intra-annual similarity of Chl-a and inorganic nutrients can be linked to the disconnection between the floodplain and the Grijalva river since the bankfull was not overflowed throughout the sampling time. The intra-annual trend independent at the time of persistence of the high Chl-a and TP concentrations ill the river-floodplain system opens up the opportunity to estimate the minimum input flow required to biogeochemical processes in a long-term study.","Cruz-Ramirez, Allan K.; Angel Salcedo, Miguel; Sanchez, Alberto J.; de Dios Mendoza, Juan; Barba, Everardo; Alvarez-Pliego, Nicolas; Florido, Rosa",Scholarly Journals,2019,29,BIOSIS:PREV202100568878,wos,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"influence of hydrological heterogeneity on rotifer community structure in three different water bodies in shantou area, guangdong (china)","Rotifers, small but essential invertebrates in aquatic ecosystems, are sensitive to environmental changes and are proposed to be indicators of trophic state. However, the effects of hydrological heterogeneity on the rotifer community and the ability of rotifer indices to reflect trophic state across different water bodies are still unclear. Here, we investigated rotifer community structure in different seasons in the three types of water bodies: Han river downstream (HD), Reservoir (RE) and Tidal creek (TC) in Shantou City, Guangdong, China. Our findings revealed that rotifer community structure differes significantly among the three water bodies, resulting from a dominance of Keratella cochlearis, Anuraeopsis fissa and Polyarthra vulgaris, who largely accounted for the differences in water bodies. Chlorophyll-a and transparency were the main environmental drivers in RE rotifer communities, while total nitrogen, total phosphorus and salinity were the main factors in HD and TC communities. Rotifer abundance and the rotifer trophic state index decreased in the order: RE > HD > TC. However, both the Sladecek's B/T quotient and the Keratella-index decreased in the order: HD > RE > TC, which was in accordance with the Carlson's trophic index. We conclude that it is efficient to use rotifer composition in water quality assessments when comparing different water bodies. Alpha diversity of rotifers was the highest in HD, which is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Hydrological heterogeneity is the micro-factor that regulates rotifer community structures in the Shantou area.","Liang, Diwen; Wei, Nan; Wang, Qing; Jersabek, Christian D.; He, Xuejia; Yang, Yufeng",Scholarly Journals,2019,58,BIOSIS:PREV201900931662,wos,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"bacterioplankton from two hungarian danube river wetlands (beda-karapancsa, danube-drava national park) and its relations to environmental variables","Seasonal and spatial distribution of bacterioplankton from two Hungarian oxbow lake type wetlands, Mocskos-Danube and Riha, was studied. They were both covered by macrophytes and they had different hydrological connectivity to the Danube. The six sampling campaigns from April to October 2014 included parallel samples from the Danube River at Mohacs, Hungary. Bacterial abundance was the highest in spring and in Mocskos-Danube, followed by Mohacs and Riha. Positive relationships existed between bacterioplankton and temperature on one hand and suspended solids, pH, PO4-P and chl-a on the other. Negative correlations were with DOC, dissolved oxygen and NH4-N.","Kalcheva, Hristina; Dinka, Maria; Agoston-Szabo, Edit; Berczik, Arpad; Kalchev, Roumen; Tarjanyi, Nikolett; Kiss, Anita",Scholarly Journals,2016,18,BIOSIS:PREV201800624763,wos,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
connectivity and habitat typology drive co2 and ch4 fluxes across land-water interfaces in lowland rivers,"Lowland rivers are assumed to be a net source of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). However, little is known about the contribution of marginal permanent and temporary riverine aquatic systems to river carbon metabolism. Elevation, in relation to flooding, hydro-morphological, and ecological features of such habitats, can affect the gas fluxes across the water-atmosphere interfaces and the periodically air-exposed riverbeds. This hypothesis was investigated in the lowland sector of the Po River (Northern Italy) from May to September 2008. Five different aquatic habitats were considered: the main river course; a backwater habitat; and three lateral lentic waterbodies-an oxbow and two quarry lakes of different age. The water mass was always CO2 and CH4 supersaturated, and gas fluxes were from the water to the atmosphere. In the highly dynamic river course and backwaters, CO2 emission rates were nearly one order of magnitude greater than in the lentic and hypoxic oxbow and quarry lakes. By contrast, CH4 fluxes peaked in the lentic, deeper, and permanent water bodies. At sediment-atmosphere interfaces, the CO2 emissions increased along an organic matter, a water saturation, and a chlorophyll a gradient, attaining the maximum rates in the periodically air-exposed riverbed and marginal sandy sediments. These differences in gas fluxes resulted from either the submersion persistence or the alternation of submersion and emersion phases, which were ultimately due to the gap between elevation and river water variations. All this stresses the critical role of marginal aquatic habitats for river C budget.","Bolpagni, Rossano; Laini, Alex; Mutti, Tiziana; Viaroli, Pierluigi; Bartoli, Marco",Scholarly Journals,2019,12,BIOSIS:PREV201900212838,wos,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
