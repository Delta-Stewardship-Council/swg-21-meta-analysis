complex hydroperiod induced carryover responses for survival growth and endurance of a pond breeding amphibian ,"Assessing carryover effects from the aquatic to the terrestrial stage of pond-breeding amphibians is critical as temperature and hydrologic regimes of temporary ponds continue to be altered as a result of climate change and other stressors. We evaluated carryover effects of hydroperiod length (50-62 days) on amphibian survival, developmental rates, and locomotor performance using a model organism, the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), through aquatic and terrestrial mesocosm experiments with individual tests of locomotor performance. We found that shorter hydroperiods (50 days) had low larval survival (0.44 ± 0.03) compared to the 62-day hydroperiod (0.91 ± 0.09) and increased developmental rates, resulting in smaller sizes at metamorphosis. We did not find evidence of carryover effects on terrestrial survival three months post-metamorphosis with all hydroperiod treatments showing high terrestrial survival (0.88 ± 0.07). However, post-metamorphic frogs from the longer hydroperiod treatments grew faster and larger compared to individuals from shortest hydroperiods and performed significantly better during endurance trials at 18 °C. Disentangling complex carryover effects across multiple life stages in species with high phenotypic plasticity can shed light on the physiological capacity of species to respond to changing environments and inform mechanistic predictions of persistence in the face of anthropogenic stressors.","Thompson, Cassandra M;Popescu, Viorel D",Scholarly Journals,2021,195,2494302612,proquest,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
patterns of fish communities and water quality in impounded lakes of china s south to north water diversion project,"Understanding the ecological impacts of large-scale hydraulic projects is critical for maintaining ecosystem health while meeting human water needs. It is, however, currently hindered by a lack of direct evidence on ecological impacts associated with this type of project particularly on water quality and fish communities. Here, we characterized patterns and variations of fish communities and water quality in five impounded lakes of the Chinese South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), with the aim of better understanding potential ecological impacts of inter-basin water transfers. We found that 1) the impacts of water transfer on water quality in the impounded lakes was generally characterized by hydrological parameters (e.g. total suspended solids, turbidity, transparency, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and total hardness) in an upstream-downstream direction; 2) increased hydrological connectivity may have favored biological invasion (e.g. Tridentiger bifasciatus) and promoted a potential biotic homogenization among the impounded lakes; and 3) there was a pattern of decreased fish abundance and biomass from the upstream to downstream lakes with fish communities strongly driven by changing water quality patterns across the impounded lakes. These findings improve our understanding of ecological impacts of large-scale hydraulic projects and provide a significant basis for water agencies with similar water transfer systems to optimize their water transfer management in order to minimize ecological impacts.","Guo, Chuanbo;Chen, Yushun;Gozlan, Rodolphe E;Liu, Han;Lu, Ying;Qu, Xiao;Wang, Lizhu;Xia, Wentong;Xie, Songguang;Xiong, Fangyuan",Scholarly Journals,2020,713,2388744981,proquest,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
so close so far differences in long term chlorophyll a variability in three nearby estuarine coastal stations,"Three sampling stations located in the inner Patos Lagoon estuary, the lagoon's mouth and the adjacent coastal beach were visited monthly from the end of 1992 until 2014. The stations are in close proximity, but are distributed along saline and hydrological gradients and had never previously been analysed together. Our main questions were: (1) Are the monthly, seasonal and interannual variations in chlorophyll a (Chl a) similar for the three stations? (2) Is there any type of connectivity among the sites? (3) What forces are responsible for controlling phytoplankton variability at these stations? The three stations showed distinct Chl a variability patterns, with higher concentration and variability at the beach station, where the seasonal variation presented higher values between May and October, seemingly out of phase with the estuarine station, where higher values occurred between September and January. The lagoon's mouth station acted as a transit region and incorporated the variability of the estuarine and coastal regions, and all three stations showed a lasting long-term influence from the remote and large-scale phenomenon El Nino Southern Oscillation, El Nino and La Nina periods being characterized by an increase in rainfall and drought conditions, respectively, in the region. The three stations showed no clear connectivity since the cross correlation analysis did not indicate subsequent (more than one month) influence of any station on the others with regard to Chl a. However, a large transfer of the surf-zone diatom, Asterionellopsis guyunusae, from the coast towards the estuary was observed in an apparent 'inverted outwelling' process. Chl a variability did not show a straight relationship with most of the measured abiotic variables, indicating that other forces such as residence time may be of greater importance.","Abreu, Paulo Cesar;Marangoni, Juliano;Odebrecht, Clarisse",Scholarly Journals,2017,13,1919960982,proquest,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
using stressor response models to derive numeric nutrient criteria for lakes in the eastern plain ecoregion china,"Lakes in the Eastern Plain ecoregion of China are typically shallow, experience large disturbances, and are hydrologically connected to rivers. In recent years, lake eutrophication in this ecoregion has intensified due to human activities. To determine important regional nutrient criteria, the effects of hydrologic features and disturbances should be taken into account. In this paper, annual average data were used to construct stressor-response models for each hydrological lake type identified for lakes in the Eastern Plain ecoregion. In these models, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) criteria were obtained from a chlorophyll a (Chl-a, response variable) threshold value. A Chl-a concentration of 4.73 mu gL super(-1) was identified as this threshold value, which was based on the cyanotoxin limits associated with drinking water supply. The three lake types, which differed in hydrological structure, had significantly different TN and TP criteria. For example, lakes connected to the Yangtze River (T sub(1)) had a TN criterion ranging from 0.594 to 0.838mgL super(-1), which was substantially higher than those for lakes that were never connected to the river (T sub(3), 0.234-0.422mgL super(-1)). The exception to this trend occurred for lakes that were historically but not currently connected to the river (T sub(2)) due to P-limitation in this lake type. However, there was little variability in the TP criterion among T sub(1), T sub(2), and T sub(3) lakes, the values of which ranged from 0.021 to 0.037, 0.023 to 0.042, and 0.028 to 0.041mgL super(-1), respectively. This study hypothesized that the hydrological connectivity between lakes and rivers could regulate the relationships between stressors and their biological responses in lakes in the Eastern Plain ecoregion, leading to variability in appropriate nutrient criteria for different lake types. Setting nutrient criteria for the entire ecoregion and for different lake types by using stressor-response models will make the criteria values more credible and defensible.","Zhang, Yali;Huo, Shouliang;Ma, Chunzi;Xi, Beidou;Li, Xiang;Liu, Hongliang",Scholarly Journals,2014,42,1627975893,proquest,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
a limnological examination of the southwestern amazon madre de dios peru ,"This dissertation investigates the limnology of the southwestern Peruvian Amazon centered on the Madre de Dios department by examining first the geomorphology and then the ecology and biogeochemistry of the region's fluvial systems. Madre de Dios, Peru is world renowned for its prolific biodiversity and its location within the Andes biodiversity hotspot. It is also a site of study regarding the development of the Fitzcarrald Arch and that feature's geomorphological importance as the drainage center for the headwaters of the Madeira River--the Amazon's largest tributary and as well as its role as a physical divider of genetic evolution in the Amazon. Though each of these has been studied by a variety of prominent researchers, the ability to investigate all the aspects of this unique region is hampered by the lack of a regional geomorphological map. This study aims to fill that gap by using remote sensing techniques on digital elevation models, satellite imagery and soil, geology and geoecological maps already in publication to create a geomorphological map. The resulting map contains ten distinct landform types that exemplify the dominance of fluvial processes in shaping this landscape. The river terraces of the Madre de Dios River are delineated in their entirety as well as the various dissected relief units and previously undefined units. The demarcation of the boundaries of these geomorphic units will provide invaluable assistance to the selection of field sites by future researchers as well as insights into the origin of the high biodiversity indices of this region and aid in planning for biodiversity conservation. Secondly this study examines 25 tropical floodplain lakes along 300 km of the Manu River within the Manu National Park in the Madre de Dios department. Alternative stable state and regime shifts in shallow lakes typically have been examined in lakes in temperate and boreal regions and within anthropogenically disturbed basins but have rarely been studied in tropical or in undisturbed regions. In contrast this study focuses on a tropical region of virtually no human disturbance and evaluates the effects of hydrological variability on ecosystem structure and dynamics. Using satellite imagery a 23 yr timeline of ecological regime shifts in Amazon oxbow lakes or ""cochas"" is reconstructed. The study shows that almost 25% of the river's floodplain lakes experience periodic abrupt vegetative changes with an average 3.4% existing in an alternative stable state in any given year. State changes typically occur from a stable phytoplankton-dominated state to a short lived, <3 yr, floating macrophytic state and often occur independent of regional flooding. We theorize that multiple dynamics, both internal and external, drive vegetative regime shifts in the Manu but insufficient data yet exists in this remote region to identify the key processes. To complete the investigation of tropical limnology the third study compares and contrasts the nutrient-productivity ration of floodplain and non-floodplain lakes globally and regionally. For over 70 years a strong positive relationship between sestonic chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total phosphorus (TP) has been established with phosphorus generally viewed as the most limiting factor to productivity. Most of these studies, however, have focused on northern, temperate regions where the lakes are typically postglacial, isolated and fed by small streams. Relatively little work has been done on floodplain lakes which are semi or permanently connected to the river. This study examines the relationship between nutrients and productivity in floodplain lakes globally through an extensive literature synthesis. Values for total phosphorus, total nitrogen and chlorophyll-a were collected for 523 floodplain lakes, represented by 288 data points while 551 data points were collected for 5444 non-floodplain lakes. Analysis revealed that globally, floodplain lakes do not show any significant difference in the total phosphorus/chlorophyll-a relationship from that found in non-floodplain lakes but significant differences are seen between tropical and temperate lakes. We propose that the term 'floodplain' lake should serve as purely a geographical descriptor and that it is lacking as an ecological indicator. Instead factors such as precipitation seasonality, hydrological connectivity and regional flooding regimes are better indicators of high or low productivity in floodplain lakes.","Belcon, Alana Urnesha",Books,2012,73,1439231762,proquest,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
spatial heterogeneity in trophic status of shallow lakes on the boreal plain influence of hydrologic setting,"We used metrics of surface water and groundwater connectivity as explanatory variables in nonparametric regression models to explain the spatial heterogeneity in trophic status of shallow lakes. The concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a) was used as an indicator of trophic status and was estimated from 17 Landsat images acquired during the end of summer (August) over a 20-year period from 1984 to 2003. A long-term median of Chl a was computed for each of 40 lakes on the basis of the 17-year data set. Hydrologic metrics explained 72% of the spatial variation in Chl a. The regression tree showed that lakes with a higher concentration of calcium plus magnesium (Ca + Mg) exhibited higher Chl a than lakes with a lower Ca + Mg. We hypothesized that this trend was a result of either higher internal nutrient loading in high Ca + Mg lakes due to groundwater discharge or differences in surficial geology. Among high Ca + Mg lakes, lakes with no inflowing streams had lower Chl a, while connected lakes had higher Chl a, possibly reflecting enhanced nutrient delivery to lakes connected to the stream network. Among low Ca + Mg lakes, lakes with larger wetland cover in their drainage basins had lower Chl a, while lakes with smaller wetland cover in their drainage basins had higher Chl a, possibly reflecting differential water loading rates between small and large wetlands that lead to either Chl a concentration or dilution. These results suggest that relatively simple hydrologic metrics can be used to predict the trophic status of lakes in this area of the boreal forest.","Sass, G Z;Creed, I F;Devito, K J",Scholarly Journals,2008,44,48182161,proquest,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
role of lhcii containing macrodomains in the structure function and dynamics of grana,"In higher plants and green algae two types of thylakoids are distinguished, granum (stacked) and stroma (unstacked) thylakoids. They form a three-dimensional (3D) network with large lateral heterogeneity: photosystem II (PSII) and the associated main chlorophyll a/b light-harvesting complex (LHCII) are found predominantly in the stacked region, while PSI and LHCI are located mainly in the unstacked region of the membrane. This picture emerged from the discovery of the physical separation of the two photosystems (Boardman and Anderson 1964). Granal chloroplasts possess significant flexibility, which is essential for optimizing the photosynthetic machinery under various environmental conditions. However, our understanding concerning the assembly, structural dynamics and regulatory functions of grana is far from being complete. In this paper we overview the significance of the three-dimensional structure of grana in the absorption properties, ionic equilibrations, and in the diffusion of membrane components between the stacked and unstacked regions. Further, we discuss the role of chiral macrodomains in the grana. Lateral heterogeneity of thylakoid membranes is proposed to be a consequence of the formation of macrodomains constituted of LHCII and PSII; their long range order permits long distance migration of excitation energy, which explains the energetic connectivity of PSII particles. The ability of macrodomains to undergo light-induced reversible structural changes lends structural flexibility to the granum. In purified LHCII, which has also been shown to form stacked lamellar aggregates with long range chiral order, excitation energy migrates for large distances; these macroaggregates are also capable of undergoing light-induced reversible structural changes and fluorescence quenching. Hence, some basic properties of grana appear to originate from its main constituent, the LHCII.","Garab, G;Mustardy, L",Scholarly Journals,1999,NA,925182554,proquest,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
lake age and water level affect the turbidity of floodplain lakes along the lower rhine ,"1. We sampled a set of 93 lakes situated in the floodplains of the lower River Rhine in search for morphometric and other factors that explain their variation in clarity. 2. Lakes with a drop in summer water level were less turbid at the time of sampling, mainly because of a lower concentration of inorganic suspended solids (ISS). 3. We also found that older lakes were more turbid than younger lakes and that this was largely because of an increase in phytoplankton. 4. Water clarity was positively related to lake depth and the presence of vegetation. 5. Model calculations indicated that the underwater light climate was strongly affected by chlorophyll and ISS, the latter being the dominant factor affecting Secchi depth. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was less important. 6. The high concentration of ISS suggests that intensive resuspension occurs in most of the lakes. Using a simple wave model, and assuming that vegetation protects sediments against resuspension, we could eliminate wind resuspension as an important process in 90% of the lakes, leaving resuspension by benthivorous fish as probably the most important factor determining transparency. 7. Chlorophyll a concentration showed a strong positive correlation to ISS concentration, suggesting that resuspension may also have a positive effect on phytoplankton biomass in these lakes. 8. In conclusion, in-lake processes, rather than river dynamics, seem to be driving the turbidity of floodplain lakes along the lower River Rhine.","Roozen, F. C. J. M.; Van Geest, G. J.; Ibelings, B.

seasonal fluctuation of some limnological variables on a floodplain lake patos lagoon of the upper parana river mato grosso do sul state brazil ,"Temporal variations of some limnological variables in limnetic and littoral regions of Patos lagoon, a varzea lake on the floodplain of the Upper Parana River (22degree 43'12S e 53degree 17'37W), were studied in relation to hydrological and climatological factors. Measurements of water temperature, euphotic zone, suspended material, electrical conductivity, total alkalinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, total nitrogen, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, dissolved phosphorus, reactive soluble phosphorus and chlorophyll a were taken monthly between March 1993 and February 1994. Results lend evidence to the importance of the hydrological regime on the dynamic of limnological variables in floodplain lakes. A dilution of nutrients in the lagoon, especially phosphates, occurred during floods. This was followed by fertilization of the environment by nutrients from the inundated marginal regions. During low connectivity periods, autochthonous, events such as ressuspension of sediment, brought on by wind and rain, governed limnological events in the lagoon.","Rodrigues, Luzia Cleide; Train, Sueli; Roberto, Maria do Carmo; Pagioro, Thomaz Aurelio",Scholarly Journals,2002,45,BIOSIS:PREV200300162521,wos,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
effects of flow variation on channel and floodplain biota and habitats of the sacramento river california usa,"1. Despite progress in the development of conceptual models of river processes, the validation and application of these models to conservation may be limited by a deficit of tools for intermediate-scale (1-100km) reaches. A model was developed to examine the effect of variation in flow on the responses of two trophic levels in a large temperate river (Sacramento River) and its seasonal floodplain (Yolo Bypass). Field data and hydrologic simulations were evaluated for three hydrologically diverse years. 2. The simulations showed much more hydrologic variability in the floodplain than the river, with greater total surface and shallow area, longer hydraulic residence times, and lower water velocities for the floodplain. 3. Chlorophyll a levels were significantly higher in the floodplain than in the river, and were negatively associated with flow. These results were consistent with longer hydraulic residence times, increased surface area of shallow water, and warmer water temperatures. 4. Copepods and cladoceran densities were similar in the river and its floodplain, and were mostly negatively associated with flow. 5. There were significantly higher densities of Diptera and terrestrial invertebrates in the floodplain than the river. Diptera densities in the floodplain were positively associated with flow. 6. These results provide evidence of the incremental value of floodplain habitat to the conservation of large rivers. In particular, it appears that providing river floodplain connectivity can enhance production of lower trophic levels at relatively rapid time scales, probably benefitting secondary consumers, including Chinook salmon (Onchyrhynchus tshawytscha).

the lake catchment lakecat dataset characterizing landscape features for lake basins within the conterminous usa,"Natural and human-related landscape features influence the ecology and water quality of lakes. Summarizing these features in a hydrologically meaningful way is critical to understanding and managing lake ecosystems. Such summaries are often done by delineating watershed boundaries of individual lakes. However, many technical challenges are associated with delineating hundreds or thousands of lake watersheds at broad spatial extents. These challenges can limit the application of analyses and models to new, unsampled locations. We present the Lake-Catchment (LakeCat) Dataset (https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/lakecat) of watershed features for 378,088 lakes within the conterminous USA. We describe the methods we used to: 1) delineate lake catchments, 2) hydrologically connect nested lake catchments, and 3) generate several hundred watershed-level metrics that summarize both natural (e.g., soils, geology, climate, and land cover) and anthropogenic (e.g., urbanization, agriculture, and mines) features. We illustrate how this data set can be used with a random forest model to predict the probability of lake eutrophication by combining LakeCat with data from US Environmental Protection Agency's National Lakes Assessment (NLA). This model correctly predicted the trophic state of 72% of NLA lakes, and we applied the model to predict the probability of eutrophication at 297,071 unsampled lakes across the conterminous USA. The large suite of LakeCat metrics could be used to improve analyses of lakes at broad spatial extents, improve the applicability of analyses to unsampled lakes, and ultimately improve the management of these important ecosystems.","Hill, Ryan A.; Weber, Marc H.; Debbout, Rick M.; Leibowitz, Scott G.; Olsen, Anthony R.",Scholarly Journals,2018,37,BIOSIS:PREV201800492376,wos,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
periphyton response to simulated nonpoint source pollution local over regional control,"We investigated functional and structural responses of periphyton communities to simulated nonpoint source (NPS) pollution over a 2-year period. Periphyton communities were examined in three unique but hydrologically connected habitats in the lower Muskegon River: river, wetland, and lake. Our study addressed several major questions: (1) what are the effects of nonpoint source pollutants on periphyton structure and function, (2) to what degree do environmental conditions, including the pollutant delivery system and hydrologic conditions, affect periphyton response, and (3) do periphyton communities show synchronous responses to nonpoint source pollution? Nutrients were added over a 21-day period in each of the four seasons over 2 years. The effect of road salt on metabolism was evaluated in the winter and spring seasons in the river habitat only. In general, the periphyton community showed complex responses to the NPS amendments, but there was little evidence of nutrient limitation in this system based on community structure, biomass accrual, metabolism, or alkaline phosphatase activity. This result was unexpected given the relatively low ambient concentrations of phosphorus. We discuss the possibilities that nutrient delivery was ineffective or that herbivory and/or irradiance might have constrained periphyton growth, but ultimately conclude that our results suggest that periphyton communities in the lower Muskegon River watershed were (1) nutrient-replete, (2) tolerant of short-term salt additions, and (3) influenced more by local conditions (habitat) than by regional (watershed) factors. In systems where nonpoint source pollutant delivery is diffuse and hydrologic residence time is short, the influence of nonpoint source pollutants on periphyton may be either modest or too difficult to detect using traditional endpoints.","Steinman, Alan D.; Ogdahl, Mary E.; Wessell, Kelly; Biddanda, Bopi; Kendall, Scott; Nold, Stephen",Scholarly Journals,2011,45,BIOSIS:PREV201100740998,wos,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
