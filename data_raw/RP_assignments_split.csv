1,seasonal variations in food web dynamics of floodplain lakes with contrasting hydrological connectivity in the southern gulf of mexico,"Floodplains are some of the most productive and diverse ecosystems on Earth. The Usumacinta River Basin, in the Southern Gulf of Mexico, hosts several floodplain lakes, whose integrity is threatened by water resource development. We aimed to investigate how food webs in these ecosystems vary in relation to their hydrological connectivity and seasonal flood cycles. To do this, we combined analysis of water quality and stable isotopes in two lakes with permanent connection to the Usumacinta River and two isolated lakes during dry, early rainy and late rainy season. Significant differences in chlorophyll-a, nutrients and suspended solids were reflected in distinct trophic dynamics among lakes. Stable isotope analysis revealed that fish from all lakes relied predominantly on autochthonous primary production, but while phytoplankton was the dominant resource for fish in the isolated lakes, aquatic macrophytes made the highest contribution to consumers’ production in the connected lakes. Fish tended to have broader isotopic niches during the early rainy season, likely reflecting consumption of a wider range of resources following the first flow pulses of the year. Our study highlights the importance of hydrological connectivity and natural flow regimes to maintain the outstanding biodiversity and fishery yield of these floodplain ecosystems.","Cazzanelli, Matteo;Soria-Barreto, Miriam;Castillo, María Mercedes;Rodiles-Hernández, Rocío",Scholarly Journals,2021,848,2574330225,proquest,RP,LY,N,lake,Y,water quality and stable isotope,stable isotope,Y,all lakes but has chla and water quality
2,shifts of environmental and phytoplankton variables in a regulated river: a spatial-driven analysis,"The longitudinal structure of the environmental and phytoplankton variables was investigated in the Ebro River (NE Spain), which is heavily affected by water abstraction and regulation. A first exploration indicated that the phytoplankton community did not resist the impact of reservoirs and barely recovered downstream of them. The spatial analysis showed that the responses of the phytoplankton and environmental variables were not uniform. The two set of variables revealed spatial variability discontinuities and river fragmentation upstream and downstream from the reservoirs. Reservoirs caused the replacement of spatially heterogeneous habitats by homogeneous spatially distributed water bodies, these new environmental conditions downstream benefiting the opportunist and cosmopolitan algal taxa. The application of a spatial auto-regression model to algal biomass (chlorophyll-a) permitted to capture the relevance and contribution of extra-local influences in the river ecosystem.","Sabater-Liesa, Laia;Ginebreda, Antoni;Barceló, Damià",Scholarly Journals,2018,642,2084071810,proquest,RP,DC,N,river,Y,chla,not specified,Y,looks at regulation impacts downstream of impoundments via chla
3,towards deconfounding hydrological and seasonal temperature variability in the determination of selected limnological variables of a temperate floodplain ecosystem,"This paper presents a methodological approach that can aid the assessment of variation in limnological variables in response to hydrological phases and seasonal temperature variation. The investigation was conducted in the Danube River floodplain, Kopacki Rit, Croatia. The proposed approach facilitates a more accurate examination of the effects of first factor, while maintaining second factor less variable, and vice versa. Samples were collected in the floodplain channel and lake along a temporal connectivity gradient, and were grouped according to three hydrological phases (isolation, flow pulse and flood pulse) and according to three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). A permutational multivariate analysis of variance was used to analyse the hydrological effects within seasons, as well as seasonal effects within hydrological phases on selected limnological variables: pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nitrites, nitrates, ammonium, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a concentrations and ratio of copiotrophic to oligotrophic bacteria. A multivariate data cloud was structured by hydrological phases during all investigated seasons, but not by all seasons during different hydrological phases. The strongest impact of hydrological phases on limnological variables occurred during summer. Seasonal effects were significant during the isolation and the flood pulse phases. The flow pulse phase somehow obscured the effects of seasonal change, resulting in temporal floodplain homogenization. One possible explanation is that water temperature determines potential limnological conditions, whereas hydrology determines actual conditions. Such results must be taken into account if the accurate effects of hydrology and seasonal change are to be assessed in temperate floodplain ecosystems.

4,short-term succession of aquatic plant species richness along ecosystem productivity and dispersal gradients in shallow lakes,"Questions: The highest species richness is usually expected at an intermediate stage of development since the last major disturbance event, but some studies have shown that ecosystem productivity and dispersal may modify this pattern, suggesting the need for further studies on the effects of productivity and dispersal on the dynamics of species richness through succession. In this study, we analysed aquatic plant species richness in relation to (1) succession stage, measured as numbers of years since the last disturbance that affected the ecosystems; (2) lake productivity, measured as the chlorophyll a concentration; and (3) connectivity to similar nearby ecosystems, a proxy for the potential input of diaspores. Location: Shallow lakes of the Dombes region, France. Methods: Every 5-7 yr these shallow lakes are emptied and left to dry out for 1 yr. These drought disturbances lead to complete destruction of the submerged aquatic plant communities. Sixty lakes arranged along a gradient of productivity were selected. The probability of diaspore input was considered to increase from upstream to downstream, as lakes are organized in hydrologically connected networks via ditches, through which the downstream lakes receive water from the upstream lakes. For each lake, the aquatic plant species richness (from systematic summer vegetation sampling), time since the last disturbance (last summer drying), productivity (estimated as chlorophyll a concentration) and probability of diaspore input (assessed from position in the network) were recorded. Results: The aquatic plant species richness decreased with the time since the last disturbance for all of the lakes, but there was a significant interaction with the chlorophyll a concentration and position of the lake in the network. At the lowest ecosystem productivities, the relationship between successional stage and species richness was hump-shaped, whereas the species richness decreased with increasing time since the last disturbance when productivity increased. The lake's position in the network did not influence species richness during the first 2 yr after disturbance, but from year 3 and thereafter, lakes connected to high numbers of upstream lakes consistently exhibited decreased richness, contradicting the expected trend of increasing species richness with increasing diaspore inputs. Conclusions: This study indicates that both ecosystem productivity and connectivity strongly affected the relationship between aquatic plant species richness and succession, and that these factors should be taken into account in further developments of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. In this study, we analysed the effect of the lake productivity and the lake connectivity on the relationship between aquatic plant species richness and the succession stage. These factors affected the dynamics of species richness through succession and they should be taken into account in further developments of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. © 2012 International Association for Vegetation Science.","Arthaud, F;Vallod, D;Robin, J;Bornette, G;Wezel, A",Scholarly Journals,2013,24,1315882897,proquest,RP,DC,N,lake,Y,chla,posiition in network,Y,NA
5,"factors influencing algal biomass in intermittently connected, subtropical coastal ponds","Microalgae may contribute more to salt marsh productivity than realized, underscoring the importance of understanding algal dynamics in such systems. Benthic and planktonic chlorophyll-a (surrogate for total algal biomass), sediment ash-free dry weight, total suspended solids, salinity, and nutrients were examined in intermittently connected marsh ponds in the subtropical Guadalupe Estuary, Texas, USA to determine the effects of hydrologic connections on algal biomass in this system. From May 2005 to May 2006, several high water events resulting in surface water connections between ponds and nearby tidal creeks occurred, followed by disconnection and, at times, pond desiccation. During periods of disconnection, algal biomass was higher in both the benthos and the water column than during connection events when flushing occurred. Since connection events did not increase NOx, the primary source of dissolved inorganic nitrogen seemed to be nutrient cycling within the ponds. Data at the aggregated level, i.e., chlorophyll-a, indicated this system followed the flood pulse concept. During high water events, algal biomass may be exported to supplement the tidal creek food web (aquatic), whereas during low water events accumulated biomass within the ponds feed the marsh food web (terrestrial), which includes blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and the whooping crane (Grus americana).","Miller, Carrie J;Davis, Stephen E;Roelke, Daniel L;Li, Hsiu-Ping;Driffill, Matthew J",Scholarly Journals,2009,29,21126083,proquest,RP,CP,N,lake,Y,chla,not provided,Y,salt marsh ponds
6,transversal and lateral exciton energy transfer in grana thylakoids of spinach,"The excitation energy transfer between photosystem (PS) II complexes was studied in isolated grana disks and thylakoids using chlorophyll a fluorescence induction measurements in the presence of DCMU under stacked and destacked conditions. Destacking of grana was achieved using a sonication protocol in a buffer without MgCl 2 . The degree of stacking was controlled and quantified by atomic force microscopy and by the concomitant absorption changes. As expected from the literature, intact thylakoids showed a strong dependency of the connectivity of PSII centers, the F m /F o ratio as well as the fraction of PSII(beta) centers on the MgCl 2 concentration. In contrast, these parameters did not change in isolated grana disks. In particular, the connectivity remained constantly high irrespective of the degree of destacking. These differences were explained by the high protein density in grana disks, which hinders separation and mixing of proteins sufficiently to change energy transfer properties. Due to the occurrence of stroma lamella in intact thylakoids, intermixing of PSII and PSI is possible and allows for changes in F m /F o ratio as is the separation of LHCII from PSII, thus leading to an increase in the fraction of PSII(beta). Even if mixing and separation of proteins are impaired in isolated grana disks, destacking should lead to a decrease in connectivity if transversal excitation energy transfer between two opposite membranes is significant. Because the connectivity is constant over all degrees of destacking employed, we conclude that the energy transfer in granas is mainly lateral.","Kirchhoff, H;Borinski, M;Lenhert, S;Chi, L;Büchel, C",Scholarly Journals,2004,NA,925361516,proquest,RP,DC,NA,NA,Y,NA,NA,N,all about spinach
7,spatial variability of chlorophyll-a and abiotic variables in a river-floodplain system during different hydrological phases,"Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and abiotic variables were measured in the main channel and floodplain waterbodies of the Middle Parana River to analyse the system dynamics and to assess their spatial variability during different hydrological phases, including an extreme flood. We wanted to test that the flood does not always have a homogenising effect in a river-floodplain system. An explanatory model for Chl-a was performed according to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), and the relation of water level with the coefficient of variation (CV) among sites for each variable was explored. The model explained 64% of Chl-a variability. Water level, depth:euphotic zone ratio (Z (d):Z (eu)) (inverse correlation) and conductivity (direct correlation) were the significant explicative variables. The CV of Chl-a decreased with flood from the main channel to the floodplain, but for turbidity, Z (d):Z (eu), pH, dissolved oxygen, soluble reactive phosphorus and Chl-a:pheophytin-a ratio, it increased. However, within the floodplain, CV of turbidity, Z (d):Z (eu) and pH decreased during flood. These suggest that the homogenising effect frequently observed during inundation cannot be generalised and that the floodplain may maintain its identity even during flood. The extreme flood and its overlap with the warm season and sedimentological pulse probably contributed to the heterogeneity in the spatial gradient.","Mayora, Gisela; Devercelli, Melina; Giri, Federico",Scholarly Journals,2013,717,BIOSIS:PREV201300670242,wos,RP,LY,N,floodplain,Y,chla,coefficient of variation,Y,NA
8,"trophic state and water quality in the danube floodplain lake (kopacki rit nature park, croatia) in relation to hydrological connectivity","The investigated floodplain lake is located in the marginal part of the Kopacki Rit Nature Park, Croatia, a floodplain area of the Danube. In this chapter, we have assessed the influence of hydrological connectivity with the main channel on the trophic state and water quality in the Lake Sakadas. The evaluation of trophic state combines a number of physical, chemical and biological parameters with the objective to select the relevant indicators for the floodplain lakes. The following environmental parameters have been considered: water temperature, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, water transparency, chlorophyll-a concentration, phytoplankton primary productivity, benthic and periphytic communities and laboratory experiments (nutrient enrichment bioassay). An integrative approach, which includes in situ research and laboratory experiments, indicated strong correlations of abiotic and biotic components with a hydrological regime. Also, during the biological monitoring, occurrence and spread of invasive species was noted as an indication of ecosystem disturbance (hydrological and/or anthropogenic). Therefore, our results contribute to the perception of importance of the hydrological connectivity (by inundation) on the eutrophication process in the investigated floodplain lake.","Persic, Vesna; Cerba, Dubravka; Bogut, Irella; Horvatic, Janja",Books,2011,NA,BIOSIS:PREV201100325239,wos,RP,MB,N,floodplain,Y,chla and others,inundation,Y,NA
9,benthic algal response to hyporheic-surface water exchange in an alluvial river,"We studied the response of benthic algae to points of hyporheic-surface water exchange in the main channel of the Middle Fork Flathead River within the Nyack Flood Plain, Montana. We examined hyporheic exchange at 120 sites using piezometers and measuring vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG), hydraulic conductivity, and vertical discharge. We removed benthic algae from a single cobble at each site, and we used VHG to group sampling sites for statistical analysis. Algal cell density and chlorophyll a concentration were significantly higher at sites with hyporheic discharge (+VHG, upwelling) compared to both sites with hyporheic recharge (-VHG, downwelling) and sites with no hyporheic-surface water exchange (=VHG, neutral) (ANOVA, P < 0.05). The assemblages of algae at upwelling sites were also significantly different from downwelling and neutral exchange sites (ANOSIM, P < 0.05). Filamentous green algae Stigeoclonium sp. and Zygnema sp. and a chrysophyte, Hydrurus foetidus (Villars) Trevisan were abundant at upwelling sites, whereas an assemblage of diatoms Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kutzing) Czarnecki, Cymbella excisa Kutzing, Diatoma moniliformis Kutzing, and Gomphonema olivaceoides Hustedt, were the most abundant taxa at downwelling and neutral exchange sites, occurring attached to, or in close association with the stalks of Didymosphenia geminata (Lyngbye) Schmidt. These data show that benthic algal communities are structured differently depending on the direction of hyporheic flux in the main channel of a large alluvial river, suggesting that hyporheic-surface exchange may influence the spatial distribution of main-channel benthic algae in rivers with hyporheic-surface water connectivity.","Wyatt, Kevin H.; Hauer, F.

10,spatial distribution of nutrient limitation in the danube river floodplain in relation to hydrological connectivity,"In this paper, we describe the influence of flooding on nutrient conditions and phytoplankton Chl-a concentrations in a hydrologically dynamic Danube floodplain in North-Eastern Croatia. Based on hydrological typology, the connectivity gradient extends from the main river stream (Eupotamal) to the backwater channels and side-arms (Parapotamal) to the edge of the floodplain (Paleopotamal). A spatial gradient of phytoplankton Chl-a occurred during low water levels, while uniformity of Chl-a across wetland habitats was observed during high water levels. Nutrient enrichment assays indicated that inorganic nutrients in Eupotamal waters (N/P ratio 16-22) could support a higher growth rate of the assay alga Chlorella kessleri, while potential N limitation was found in Parapotamal and Paleopotamal waters (both with N/P ratios< 14). Spatial expansion of N limitation toward the main river was observed as inundation continued. Lateral flood pulse connectivity along with the duration of inundation period affects the input and the retention of nutrients, especially of nitrogen. Understanding of the relationship between spatial (location of the floodplain waterbodies regarding the river) and temporal (hydrological connectivity between the river and its floodplain) dimensions contribute to the importance of healthy floodplains for the maintenance of water quality and environmental conditions in the Danube River.","Persic, Vesna; Horvatic, Janja",Scholarly Journals,2011,31,BIOSIS:PREV201100752041,wos,RP,MB,N,floodplain,Y,chla,categorical,Y,NA
11,periphyton response to simulated nonpoint source pollution: local over regional control,"We investigated functional and structural responses of periphyton communities to simulated nonpoint source (NPS) pollution over a 2-year period. Periphyton communities were examined in three unique but hydrologically connected habitats in the lower Muskegon River: river, wetland, and lake. Our study addressed several major questions: (1) what are the effects of nonpoint source pollutants on periphyton structure and function, (2) to what degree do environmental conditions, including the pollutant delivery system and hydrologic conditions, affect periphyton response, and (3) do periphyton communities show synchronous responses to nonpoint source pollution? Nutrients were added over a 21-day period in each of the four seasons over 2 years. The effect of road salt on metabolism was evaluated in the winter and spring seasons in the river habitat only. In general, the periphyton community showed complex responses to the NPS amendments, but there was little evidence of nutrient limitation in this system based on community structure, biomass accrual, metabolism, or alkaline phosphatase activity. This result was unexpected given the relatively low ambient concentrations of phosphorus. We discuss the possibilities that nutrient delivery was ineffective or that herbivory and/or irradiance might have constrained periphyton growth, but ultimately conclude that our results suggest that periphyton communities in the lower Muskegon River watershed were (1) nutrient-replete, (2) tolerant of short-term salt additions, and (3) influenced more by local conditions (habitat) than by regional (watershed) factors. In systems where nonpoint source pollutant delivery is diffuse and hydrologic residence time is short, the influence of nonpoint source pollutants on periphyton may be either modest or too difficult to detect using traditional endpoints.","Steinman, Alan D.; Ogdahl, Mary E.; Wessell, Kelly; Biddanda, Bopi; Kendall, Scott; Nold, Stephen",Scholarly Journals,2011,45,BIOSIS:PREV201100740998,wos,RP,ES,N,all,Y,chla/salt,categorical,Y,much more about pollution and salts but may be relevant
68,hydrologic controls on the trophic status of shallow lakes on the boreal plain,"The trophic status of shallow lakes on the Boreal Plain of Alberta exhibits high natural variation in space and time. It is not currently known what the dominant controls on this variation are at regional scales and over longer time periods. The aim of this thesis is to characterize the natural variation in trophic status, as measured by the concentration of chlorophyll a (CHLa), and assess the importance of hydrology, captured by climatic and landscape metrics, in explaining the spatial and temporal variation in trophic status. Indicators of trophic status were derived from Landsat images acquired during late summer (August) over a 20 year period from 1984 to 2003. A two-way analysis of variance revealed that of the total variation in CHLa, approximately 50 percent was in the spatial component, 10 percent was in the temporal component and 40 percent was in the spatio-temporal component, which also included the error term. Variation in the temporal component was related non-linearly to climate, as measured by effective precipitation (precipitation minus evapotranspiration). The relation between CHLa and climate indicated that under wet conditions CHLa decreased possibly due to phosphorus dilution and that under dry conditions CHLa increased possibly due to phosphorus concentration. Variation in the spatial component was related to indicators of groundwater and surface water connectivity. Lakes, situated in regional groundwater flow systems, exhibited higher CHLa than lakes situated in local groundwater flow systems. For the majority of lakes, situated in local groundwater flow systems, high wetland cover in their catchments corresponded to low CHLa whereas low wetland cover corresponded to high CHLa. For the minority of lakes, located in regional groundwater flow systems, higher stream connectivity was associated with higher CHLa. Overall, groundwater and surface water variables explained 74 percent of the spatial variation and climatic variables explained 78 percent of the temporal variation. These results underscore the importance of considering hydrology when understanding the sources of variation in trophic status measured at regional scales over long time periods. Incorporating hydrologic knowledge in resource management may help in mitigating impacts of resource activities.","Sass, Gabor Z",Books,2006,68,20435600,proquest,ES,RP,N,lake,Y,chla,groundwater connectivity,Y,based on landsat analysis but relevant
112,aquatic metabolism short-term response to the flood pulse in a mediterranean floodplain,"The pulsing of river discharge affects biodiversity and productivity of whole river-floodplain ecosystems, triggering the transport, storage and processing of carbon. In this study we investigate the short-term changes in water chemistry and net pelagic metabolism (NEP) in two floodplain lakes in response to a flood pulse. The two oxbow lakes investigated in the floodplain of the Mediterranean Ebro River (NE Spain) showed a clear temporal shift in their metabolic balance, controlled by the river discharge and associated changes in water physical and chemical characteristics. Water chemistry (turbidity, water organic matter, chlorophyll a and nutrients concentration) returned to pre-flood values after 4 days, highlighting the resilience of the ecosystem to flood pulses. Lake NEP was depressed before and during floods to a minimum of -34 mg O-2 m(-3) h(-1), and increased after the flood pulse to a maximum of +463 mg O-2 m(-3) h(-1). The phytoplankton assemblage showed before and after floods a replacement of autotrophic species (e.g. Chlorophyceans) by mixotrophic organisms (e.g. Cryptophyceans, Euglenoids). A linear mixed effects model identified abiotic factors, particularly temperature and river discharge, as significant predictors of the net aquatic metabolism and community respiration during flood conditions. Our results suggest that the role of the Ebro floodplain lakes as sources or sinks of C is complex and relative to the time scale investigated, depending strongly on the river discharge dynamics and the transport of limiting nutrients (phosphorus).","Gallardo, B.; Espanol, C.; Comin, F.

36,hydrological pulse regulating the bacterial heterotrophic metabolism between amazonian mainstems and floodplain lakes,"We evaluated in situ rates of bacterial carbon processing in Amazonian floodplain lakes and mainstems, during both high water (HW) and low water (LW) phases (p &lt; 0.05). Our results showed that bacterial production (BP) was lower and more variable than bacterial respiration, determined as total respiration. Bacterial carbon demand was mostly accounted by BR and presented the same pattern that BR in both water phases. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) showed a wide range (0.2-23%) and low mean value of 3 and 6%, (in HW and LW, respectively) suggesting that dissolved organic carbon was mostly allocated to catabolic metabolism. However, BGE was regulated by BP in LW phase. Consequently, changes in BGE showed the same pattern that BP. In addition, the hydrological pulse effects on mainstems and floodplains lakes connectivity were found for BP and BGE in LW. Multiple correlation analyses revealed that indexes of organic matter (OM) quality (chlorophyll-a, N stable isotopes and C/N ratios) were the strongest seasonal drivers of bacterial carbon metabolism. Our work indicated that: (i) the bacterial metabolism was mostly driven by respiration in Amazonian aquatic ecosystems resulting in low BGE in either high or LW phase; (ii) the hydrological pulse regulated the bacterial heterotrophic metabolism between Amazonian mainstems and floodplain lakes mostly driven by OM quality.","Vidal, Luciana O;Abril, Gwenäel;Artigas, Luiz F;Melo, Michaela L;Bernardes, Marcelo C;Lobão, Lúcia M;Reis, Mariana C;Moreira-Turcq, Patrícia;Benedetti, Marc;Tornisielo, Valdemar L;Roland, Fabio",Scholarly Journals,2015,6,1725025157,proquest,MB,RP,N,floodplain,Y,bacterial production,hydrologic pulse,Y,may not be as relevant but worth keeping for next step
