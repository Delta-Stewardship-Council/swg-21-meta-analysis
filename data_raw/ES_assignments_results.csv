1,"an abiotic typology and reference conditions for nutrients and chlorophyll-a in subtropical reservoirs (são paulo state, brazil)","The establishment of reference conditions and typology are two important steps in water resources management. The reference conditions enable the determination of how impacted an ecosystem is, while the typology facilitates the implementation of management procedures. A study of subtropical reservoirs in São Paulo State (Brazil) was performed to obtain (1) an abiotic typology, using principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (Ward's method with Euclidean distances), and (2) reference conditions for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the dry and rainy seasons for one of the established typologies. Two main statistical techniques were used: the lake population distribution approach and the trisection method. PCA identified an environmental gradient in the east-west direction, with reservoirs at higher latitudes and with larger dimensions in the west, and smaller reservoirs in eastern areas with higher altitude and higher average annual rainfall. The PCA and cluster analysis indicated that there were four main types of reservoirs. The nutrient criteria techniques, obtained for 13 type I rainy-east reservoirs, were not significantly different (t test, p &lt; 0.05). Although the methods resulted in similar reference conditions, one-way ANOVA indicated significant differences between the seasons for Chl-a, which levels were slightly higher in the rainy season. As far as we know, this is the first study to simultaneously provide an abiotic typology and reference conditions for chlorophyll-a and nutrients in different seasons, considering subtropical reservoirs in South America. This investigation makes an important contribution to the monitoring and management of subtropical reservoirs, and the promotion of dialog between the scientific community and managers, aiming at ensuring the sustainability of water bodies.","Cardoso-Silva, Sheila;Frascareli, Daniele;Silva, Daniel C V R;Figueira, Rubens César Lopes;Bittencourt, Marisa Dantas;Moschini-Carlos, Viviane;Pompêo, Marcelo",Scholarly Journals,2021,28,2465440501,proquest,ES,RP,N,reservoir,Y,"Chl-a, Total N, Total P","typology, reference conditions (?)",N,NA
2,connectivity and habitat typology drive co2</sub> and ch4</sub> fluxes across land–water interfaces in lowland rivers,"Lowland rivers are assumed to be a net source of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ). However, little is known about the contribution of marginal permanent and temporary riverine aquatic systems to river carbon metabolism. Elevation, in relation to flooding, hydro‐morphological, and ecological features of such habitats, can affect the gas fluxes across the water–atmosphere interfaces and the periodically air‐exposed riverbeds. This hypothesis was investigated in the lowland sector of the Po River (Northern Italy) from May to September 2008. Five different aquatic habitats were considered: the main river course; a backwater habitat; and three lateral lentic waterbodies—an oxbow and two quarry lakes of different age. The water mass was always CO 2 and CH 4 supersaturated, and gas fluxes were from the water to the atmosphere. In the highly dynamic river course and backwaters, CO 2 emission rates were nearly one order of magnitude greater than in the lentic and hypoxic oxbow and quarry lakes. By contrast, CH 4 fluxes peaked in the lentic, deeper, and permanent water bodies. At sediment–atmosphere interfaces, the CO 2 emissions increased along an organic matter, a water saturation, and a chlorophyll a gradient, attaining the maximum rates in the periodically air‐exposed riverbed and marginal sandy sediments. These differences in gas fluxes resulted from either the submersion persistence or the alternation of submersion and emersion phases, which were ultimately due to the gap between elevation and river water variations. All this stresses the critical role of marginal aquatic habitats for river C budget.","Rossano Bolpagni;Laini, Alex;Mutti, Tiziana;Viaroli, Pierluigi;Bartoli, Marco",Scholarly Journals,2019,12,2162166182,proquest,ES,PG,Y,"lower river, estuary",Y,"CO2, CH4","OM, Chl-a, water sat.",N,NA
3,abiotic variability among different aquatic systems of the central amazon floodplain during drought and flood events,"This paper examines water properties from lakes, channels and paleo-channels located in Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve, in Central Amazon floodplain, Amazonas, Brazil. The authors analysed surface temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, transparency, suspended inorganic and organic matter, chlorophyll-a, pheophytin, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, organic and inorganic carbon in 2009 high water phase, 2009 and 2010 low water phases. Multivariate statistical analyses of 24 aquatic systems (6 ressacas, 12 lakes and 6 channels, 142 samples) were applied to the variables. First, they analysed the entire set of variables to test for differences among phases of the hydrological year and types of aquatic systems using a PERMANOVA two-way crossed design. The results showed that the all measured limnological variables are distinct regarding both factors: types of aquatic systems and hydrological phases. In general, the magnitude and amplitude of all variables were higher in the low water phase than in the high water phase, except for water transparency in all aquatic system's types.","Affonso, A G;Queiroz, H L",Scholarly Journals,2015,75,1757013661,proquest,ES,LY,N,central Amazon floodplain,Y,"WQ timeseries, Chl-a, Phaeo, nuts",hydrologic phase (stage?),N,NA
4,floodplain lake assessment and fish assemblage dynamics in the mississippi alluvial valley (mississippi alluvial valley),"Floodplain lakes in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (MAV) provide valuable freshwater resources for states in which they occur. Thirty lakes in portions of Mississippi and Arkansas were surveyed for chlorophyll-a fluorescence and turbidity using handheld meters to determine relationships between chlorophyll-a concentrations and suspended solids. High applicability of handheld meters in the MAV presents economic benefits for monitoring the numerous lakes in the region. Additionally, twelve lakes within Bear Creek watershed, Mississippi were studied to determine how hydrologic connectivity shapes fish communities. Isolated and permanently connected floodplain lakes exhibited characteristically lacustrine and rheophilic fish communities, respectively, diversifying fishery management opportunities. Lastly, spring diel temperature and oxygen dynamics, as well as juvenile fish communities, were assessed within three habitats in a floodplain lake - pelagic environment, margin and contiguous wetlands. Variability in temperature and oxygen across the three habitats promotes spring habitat heterogeneity while supporting distinct but overlapping juvenile fish assemblages.","Steiner Andrews, Caroline Noelle",Books,2013,52,1520375284,proquest,ES,MB,N,floodplain 'lakes',Y,fish communities,habitat type,N,NA
5,"rotifer abundance, biomass, and secondary production after the recovery of hydrologic connectivity between a river and two marginal lakes (sao paulo, brazil)","Rotifera density, biomass, and secondary production on two marginal lakes of Paranapanema River were compared after the recovery of hydrologic connectivity with the river (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Daily samplings were performed in limnetic zone of both lakes during the rainy season immediately after lateral inflow of water and, in the dry period, six months after hydrologic connectivity recovery. In order to identify the factors that affect rotifer population dynamics, lake water level, volume, depth, temperature, transparency, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, conductivity, suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a were determined. Variations of water physical and chemical factors that affect rotifer population were related to the lake-river degree of connection and to water level rising after drought. The water lateral inflow from the river resulted in an increase in lake water volume, depth, and transparency and a decrease in water pH, alkalinity, and suspended solids. The lake with the wider river connection, more frequent biota exchange, and larger amount of particulate and dissolved materials was richer and more diverse, while rotifer density, biomass, and productivity were lower in both periods studied. Density, biomass, and secondary production were higher in the lake with the smaller river connection and the higher physical and chemical stability. Our results show that the connectivity affects the limnological stability, associated to seasonality. Stable conditions, caused by low connectivity in dry periods, were related with high density, biomass and secondary production. Conversely, instability conditions in rainy periods were associated to elevated richness and diversity values, caused by exchange biota due to higher connectivity.","Casanova, Silvia Maria Caglierani;Panarelli, Eliana Aparecida;Henry, Raoul",Scholarly Journals,2009,39,883018575,proquest,ES,CP,N,lake,Y,rotifer density and biomass,water stage,?,look at full paper
6,hydrologic controls on the trophic status of shallow lakes on the boreal plain,"The trophic status of shallow lakes on the Boreal Plain of Alberta exhibits high natural variation in space and time. It is not currently known what the dominant controls on this variation are at regional scales and over longer time periods. The aim of this thesis is to characterize the natural variation in trophic status, as measured by the concentration of chlorophyll a (CHLa), and assess the importance of hydrology, captured by climatic and landscape metrics, in explaining the spatial and temporal variation in trophic status. Indicators of trophic status were derived from Landsat images acquired during late summer (August) over a 20 year period from 1984 to 2003. A two-way analysis of variance revealed that of the total variation in CHLa, approximately 50 percent was in the spatial component, 10 percent was in the temporal component and 40 percent was in the spatio-temporal component, which also included the error term. Variation in the temporal component was related non-linearly to climate, as measured by effective precipitation (precipitation minus evapotranspiration). The relation between CHLa and climate indicated that under wet conditions CHLa decreased possibly due to phosphorus dilution and that under dry conditions CHLa increased possibly due to phosphorus concentration. Variation in the spatial component was related to indicators of groundwater and surface water connectivity. Lakes, situated in regional groundwater flow systems, exhibited higher CHLa than lakes situated in local groundwater flow systems. For the majority of lakes, situated in local groundwater flow systems, high wetland cover in their catchments corresponded to low CHLa whereas low wetland cover corresponded to high CHLa. For the minority of lakes, located in regional groundwater flow systems, higher stream connectivity was associated with higher CHLa. Overall, groundwater and surface water variables explained 74 percent of the spatial variation and climatic variables explained 78 percent of the temporal variation. These results underscore the importance of considering hydrology when understanding the sources of variation in trophic status measured at regional scales over long time periods. Incorporating hydrologic knowledge in resource management may help in mitigating impacts of resource activities.","Sass, Gabor Z",Books,2006,68,20435600,proquest,ES,RP,N,lake,Y,Chl-a,precipitation(?),N,NA
7,the hydrochemical response of small and shallow floodplain water bodies to temporary surface water connections with the main river,"We investigated the effects of temporary surface water connections with the main river on the water chemistry of large and small waterbodies in a Danube floodplain by comparing hydrochemical data before, during and after water exchange with the Danube during two large floods in 2009 and 2013. In addition, we studied the effects of an increased frequency of flood pulses on the water chemistry of the floodplain via long-term monitoring data. We used conservative (i.e. biologically non-reactive) parameters (alkalinity, Ca, Cl, K, Mg, Na, SO4, conductivity) to identify hydrochemical changes due to the mixing with river water. Changes in non-conservative parameters (PO4-P, NO3-N, NO2-N, NH4-N, total phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a), which deviated from pure mixing effects, were ascribed to alterations of biogeochemical processes induced by the imported river water. In large floodplain waterbodies, both conservative and non-conservative parameters changed towards Danube water concentrations during the connection with the main river and returned to pre-connection levels after the water exchange ended. Only chlorophyll-a concentrations were almost twice as high in the post-connection phase than before the connection. In small floodplain waterbodies, conservative and non-conservative parameters showed similar changes during the connection with the main river. However, the concentrations of PO4-P, total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a did not return to pre-connection levels, but increased further in the post-connection phase, exceeding even Danube water concentrations. We attribute these changes to phosphorus releases from the sediments and enhanced primary and bacterial production induced by the river water. In years with an increased flooding frequency, both conservative and non-conservative parameters approached Danube water concentrations in large floodplain waterbodies due to the increased surface water exchange. In small floodplain waterbodies, conservative parameters remained unaffected by the increased connection with the river, while nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations were considerably higher in wet years than in dry years. We conclude that the temporary input of oxygen- and nutrient-rich river water to small, mainly isolated backwaters can induce changes in benthic biogeochemical processes, which may provoke an internal eutrophication of these waterbodies.","Weigelhofer, Gabriele; Preiner, Stefan; Funk, Andrea; Bondar-Kunze, Elisabeth; Hein, Thomas",Scholarly Journals,2015,60,BIOSIS:PREV201500321559,wos,ES,PG,N,riverine,Y,multiple ,"Chl-a, nuts",Y,NA
8,influence of a drought event on hydrological characteristics of a small estuary on the amazon mangrove coast,"The effects of atypical climatic conditions, such as those of a drought event, are remarkably accentuated in minor estuaries filled with sediments and with reduced or sporadic freshwater input, where the salinity intrusion is pronounced. To understand these effects, hydrological and hydrodynamic parameters were evaluated during a drought period in a small estuary located on the eastern Amazon coast in northern Brazil. Five campaigns were conducted between June 2012 and June 2013. Samples were collected from the surface and bottom layer every 3 h over a 25-h period at three stations of the Tapera double dagger u Estuary. To compare drought and post-drought periods, in terms of salinity and chlorophyll-a, data was recorded until June 2015. Tapera double dagger u is a relatively shallow estuary of the Amazon coastal zone, which is characterized by the absence of any direct fluvial discharge, although it does receive freshwater input from adjacent wetlands, as well as less saline waters from the Caet, Estuary through the Taici Creek. Hydrological variables were controlled by rainfall levels and the tidal range, and the water became more saline and more oxygenated, with reduced dissolved nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations when precipitation decreased. A significant variation was found between the months of June 2012 (most intense drought) and 2013 (less intense drought). The connection to the neighboring Caet, Estuary and adjacent mangroves and wetlands contributed to the influx of nutrient-enriched waters. Overall, then, it is hoped that the results of this study can contribute to the understanding of the effects of drought events in other minor estuaries on the highly indented Amazon coast, as well as in other areas of the equatorial zone with similar environmental characteristics.","Carneiro Pereira, Luci Cajueiro; Rodrigues da Costa, Adila Kelly; da Costa, Rauquirio Marinho; Magalhaes, Andre; Flores-Montes, Manuel de Jesus; Jimenez, Jose A.",Scholarly Journals,2018,41,BIOSIS:PREV201800387074,wos,ES,DC,Y,estuary,Y,"salinity, chl-a",precipitation(?),?,look at full paper
9,the impact of inundation-isolation cycles on the culturable bacterioplankton in the danube river floodplain,"The investigation was conducted in the Kopacki Rit Nature Park (eastern Croatia) which is established to protect the floodplain area of the Danube River. The samples were collected monthly in four sites (channels and lakes) with increasing distance from the river. The aim of investigation was to examine trophic structure of culturable bacterioplankton in relation to inundation-isolation cycles on sampling sites with unequal degree of connection with the Danube river. A change in the ratio of copiotrophs (r- strategists) to oligotrophs (K-strategists) was expected as the different organic carbon sources emerged. The composition of variables was revealed by Principal Component Analysis of abiotic water properties (temperature, water depth, transparency, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nutrient concentrations) and the chlorophyll-a concentration. Scores of significant components were used in a Multiple Regression as independent variables and the relationship between the scores and abundance of colony forming units (CFUs) was examined. Regression model was significant only for copiotrophs, and their relative dominance was noticed in couple of samples on more isolated sampling sites. In all other samples oligotrophs were a dominant group, especially during the flood pulses or drainage after it. Their elevated abundance was equally distributed in all groups revealed by Principal Component Analysis, and corresponds to the fluvial action. Also concerning the two-way ANOVA (sites/samplings) oligotrophs are highly influenced by the sampling period i.e. inundation-isolation cycles. They are probably driven by the allochthonous organic matter provided by floods or have allochthonous origin itself. At the same time, copiotrophs are to some extent coupled with the established water properties, i.e. bottom-up controlled and their abundance is influenced by the localisation of sampling sites in the floodplain. These results describe the development of the conditions that promote habitat specific succession of the culturable bacterioplankton. Established differences had disappeared after additional inundation-isolation cycles.","Palijan, Goran; Bogut, Irella; Vidakovic, Jasna",Scholarly Journals,2008,56,BIOSIS:PREV200800604505,wos,ES,CP,N,riverine,Y,bacterioplankton,"wet-dry periods (stage, precip?)",?,look at full paper
10,terrestrialization alters organic matter dynamics and habitat quality for freshwater mussels (unionoida) in floodplain backwaters,"Anthropogenically induced reduction in flood inundation frequency often leads to terrestrialisation, which accompanies establishment and expansions of tree cover on areas formerly with little or no trees. We tested hypotheses that terrestrialisation degrades habitat for freshwater mussels (Unionoida: Unio douglasiae nipponensis and Lanceolaria grayana) by changing the organic matter (OM) dynamics in floodplain backwaters.Stable isotope composition of seston, periphyton, fine and coarse benthic particulate OM (FBPOM and CBPOM) and mussel tissues was measured to understand OM dynamics and food webs in 14 backwaters in the middle segment of the Kiso River, Japan. Isotope ratios, C:N ratio and chlorophyll a as a proxy of food resource characteristics and the frequency of hypoxia were related to mussel growth rates.delta C-13 of seston, periphyton and FBPOM was low at sites with lower inundation frequency (a greater degree of terrestrialisation), whereas such a trend was not observed for CBPOM (i.e. riparian leaf litter). Mussels fed exclusively on seston or mixtures of seston and periphyton with their delta C-13 tracking fluctuations in food resources.Sestonic delta C-13 differences were attributed to changes in dominant carbon origin from predominantly river-borne to autochthonous sources, while periphytic delta C-13 differences were possibly caused by a varying level of dependence on respiratory CO2. FBPOM-delta C-13 differences were associated with a greater contribution of CBPOM to the FBPOM pool in infrequently flooded backwaters. Variability in mussel growth was more closely related to hypoxia than food resource characteristics.We inferred that terrestrialisation changes quality of seston and benthic detritus and degrades habitat conditions largely by accumulating riparian leaf litter in the benthic detrital pool and increasing the frequency of hypoxia. The removal of riparian trees may temporarily improve habitat condition in backwaters heavily affected by terrestrialisation. However, ecological integrity in the long run requires the recovery of the process that suppresses terrestrialisation, which includes restoration of incised channels and flood pulses.","Negishi, Junjiro N.; Katsuki, Kotaro; Kume, Manabu; Nagayama, Shigeya; Kayaba, Yuichi",Scholarly Journals,2014,59,BIOSIS:PREV201400370733,wos,ES,CP,Y,riverine,Y,mussel growth rate,inundation frequency,N,"C:N ratio, isotopic composition, and Chl-a related to mussel growth"
11,"assessing the potential health risk of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in lake naivasha, kenya","This study discerned the causes of cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Naivasha (Kenya). We hypothesized that phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass respond to hydrologic cycles, peaking during the wet season, and that microcystin (MC) concentrations are highest following the bloom collapse. Hydrologic loading (inferred from rainfall and lake level changes) and phytoplankton responses in two basins of the lake were monitored over a wet season followed by a dry season between September 2010 and March 2011. Results show that both phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass peaked in both basins during the wet season, with associated peaks in particulate MC concentrations. Even though phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass were higher in the smaller deep basin, MC concentrations were lower than in the large shallow basin. The high-MC levels during the wet season were followed by a greater MC production per cyanobacteria biomass unit in the dry season in both basins. The timing of the cyanobacteria bloom suggests that its formation was likely controlled by large nutrient influxes from the contributing catchment to the lake associated with intense rainfall following an intense drought, posing a risk to the health of the community due to increased MC levels.","Raffoul, M.

119,lateral mobility of the light harvesting complex in chloroplast membranes controls excitation energy distribution in higher plants,"Chloroplast [pea] thylakoid protein phosphorylation produces changes in light-harvesting properties and in membrane structure as revealed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Protein phosphorylation resulted in an increase in the 77.degree. K fluorescence signal at 735 nm relative to that at 685 nm. In addition, a decrease in connectivity between Photosystem II centers (PS II) and a dynamic quenching of the room temperature variable fluorescence was observed upon phosphorylation. Accompanying these fluorescence changes was a 23% decrease in the amount of stacked membranes. Microscopic analyses indicated that 8.0-nm particles fracturing on the P-face moved from the stacked into the unstacked regions upon phosphorylation. The movement of the 8.0-nm particles was accompanied by the appearance of chlorophyll b and 25 to 29 kD [kiloDalton] polypeptides in isolated stroma lamellae fractions. Phosphorylation of a population of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein complexes (LHC) in grana partitions causes the migration of these pigment proteins from the PS II-rich appressed membranes into the Photosystem I (PS I) enriched unstacked regions. This increases the absorptive cross section of PS I.

31,assessing the effects of lateral hydrological connectivity alteration on freshwater ecosystems: a meta-analysis,"The alteration of lateral hydrological connectivity (LHC) is among the major causes of decline in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services in river-floodplain ecosystems. Yet, the effects of LHC alteration on aquatic ecosystems have not been rigorously tested and synthesized. Here, we conducted a literature review and meta-analysis to provide a global synthesis of the effects of LHC alteration on aquatic ecosystems, and to test the effectiveness of indicators for bioassessment. In our review we found that the effects of LHC alteration were disproportionally documented in terms of geographic distribution and research subject. Most studies were conducted in Europe and America on the biodiversity and abundance of macroinvertebrates and fish. In our meta-analysis, we compared effect sizes between pairs of three LHC levels, i.e. disconnected, moderately connected, and highly connected. We found that only a limited number of water quality indicators (e.g. chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen) and biological community indicators (e.g. fish species richness, and zooplankton abundance) showed significant differences between LHC levels. The responses of these indicators to LHC alteration differed, and sometimes in opposing directions. We found out responsive indicators and their response trends, which could not only facilitate effective biomonitoring and bioassessment with regard to engineering and restoration of LHC, but also provide scientific underpinnings of the understanding of trade-offs among the indicators. We identified knowledge gaps and provided recommendations on how to fill these gaps, which included investigating rarely documented regions, developing new indicators, and quantifying mechanistic links between LHC and ecosystem functioning and services.","Shen, Minghua;Liu, Xueqin",Scholarly Journals,2021,125,2524279576,proquest,LY,ES,?,multiple,N,WQ+biological community indicators,effect sizes of connectivity,Y,NA
41,hydrological connectivity and basin morphometry influence seasonal water-chemistry variations in tundra ponds of the northwestern hudson bay lowlands,"Due to shallow depth and high surface area-to-volume ratio, ponds of the Hudson Bay Lowlands are vulnerable to climatic and hydrological changes, but relations between hydrological processes and limnological conditions remain unknown. Here, we measured water balance and limnological variables (water chemistry, suspended sediments, chlorophyll-a) at 20 ponds near Churchill (Manitoba) three times during the ice-free season of 2010 to explore relations among hydrological connectivity, basin morphometry, and water chemistry variations. Using principal components analysis, we identified that the ponds followed one of four distinctive ""seasonal water chemistry trajectories"" (SWCT1-4). Most of the ponds that lacked apparent hydrologic connectivity displayed SWCT1, characterized by rising alkalinity and ionic content between early June and late July due to evaporative concentration. In contrast, most ponds with apparent hydrological connectivity displayed SWCT2 or SWCT3, characterized by marked changes in suspended sediment and total nitrogen concentrations due to inflow that transferred allochthonous materials from the catchment. Ponds in SWCT2 likely possessed temporary hydrological connections during periods of relatively high water supply and exhibited marked decline of suspended sediment and total nitrogen content when hydrological connection was lost. Most ponds in SWCT3 maintained active hydrological connections during all or most of the ice-free season and possessed relatively high suspended sediment and total nitrogen concentrations throughout the season. Ponds in SWCT4 possessed relatively stable water chemistry due to greater water depth and local features that reduced wind-induced sediment resuspension. We conclude that hydrological connectivity and basin morphometry exert important influence on seasonal pond water-chemistry dynamics.","White, Jerry;Hall, Roland I;Wolfe, Brent B;Light, Erin M;Macrae, Merrin L;Fishback, LeeAnn;Keller, Wendel;Paterson, Andrew M;Ruehland, Kathleen M;Blais, Jules M",Scholarly Journals,2014,46,2367028852,proquest,PG,ES,N,lakes,Y,"water chem., Chl-a, suspended sed",seasonal chemistry trajectories,N,NA
