1,a vital link: water and vegetation in the anthropocene,"This paper argues that the interplay of water, carbon and vegetation dynamics fundamentally links some global trends in the current and conceivable future Anthropocene, such as cropland expansion, freshwater use, and climate change and its impacts. Based on a review of recent literature including geographically explicit simulation studies with the process-based LPJmL global biosphere model, it demonstrates that the connectivity of water and vegetation dynamics is vital for water security, food security and (terrestrial) ecosystem dynamics alike. The water limitation of net primary production of both natural and agricultural plants - already pronounced in many regions - is shown to increase in many places under projected climate change, though this development is partially offset by water-saving direct CO sub(2) effects. Natural vegetation can to some degree adapt dynamically to higher water limitation, but agricultural crops usually require some form of active management to overcome it - among them irrigation, soil conservation and eventually shifts of cropland to areas that are less water-limited due to more favourable climatic conditions. While crucial to secure food production for a growing world population, such human interventions in water-vegetation systems have, as also shown, repercussions on the water cycle. Indeed, land use changes are shown to be the second-most important influence on the terrestrial water balance in recent times. Furthermore, climate change (warming and precipitation changes) will in many regions increase irrigation demand and decrease water availability, impeding rainfed and irrigated food production (if not CO sub(2) effects counterbalance this impact - which is unlikely at least in poorly managed systems). Drawing from these exemplary investigations, some research perspectives on how to further improve our knowledge of human-water-vegetation interactions in the Anthropocene are outlined.","Gerten, D",Scholarly Journals,2013,17,1464514962,proquest,3,LY,MB,n,NA (terrestrial?),n,net primary production (of terrestrial plants),NA,n,NA,"type, connectivity"
2,"collapse and failure of ancient agricultural stone terraces: on-site geomorphic processes, pedogenic mechanisms, and soil quality","Water is the major limiting factor for primary productivity in drylands. In ancient times, stone terraces aimed at runoff harvesting and soil erosion control were established, allowing agricultural crop production. Land abandonment and cease of maintenance have led to the collapse and failure of terraces in the hinterlands of the Roman/Byzantine city of Avdat in the arid Negev Desert, Israel. The objective of this study was to assess the geomorphic processes and pedogenic mechanisms related to terrace collapse, and their on-site impact on soil quality. We studied key properties of the top 10 cm of soil in intact-terrace plots and partially-collapsed terrace plots, as well as in ‘natural’ lands. Unexpectedly, the soil texture was finer in the partially collapsed-terrace plots (clay loam) than that in the intact-terrace plots (loam). This was attributed to transportation of mineral material by rolling, which sorts out the large primary particles. This process, which characterizes rill erosion of high erosive power, is probably the predominant surface process in this study. The soil penetration resistance was significantly greater in the partially-collapsed terrace plots, and was attributed to the continuous removal of recently deposited loose sediments and exposure of the underlying, compacted older sediments. Soil stoniness, which was 16-fold greater in the partially-collapsed terrace plots, was also attributed to soil erosion. Unexpectedly, the total organic carbon was similar in both terrace states. Yet, labile organic carbon was 41% lower in soil of the partially-collapsed terrace plots, suggesting greater susceptibility of this fraction to erosional processes. The low electrical conductivity in the soil of the intact-terrace plots, was attributed to the better leaching of salts. The soil's calculated available water capacity was 42% greater in the intact-terrace plots. The study suggests that these processes and mechanisms strengthen each other through a chain of feedbacks, resulting in accelerated degradation of the collapsed-terrace lands.","Stavi, Ilan;Gusarov, Yulia;Halbac-Cotoara-Zamfir, Rares",Scholarly Journals,2019,344,2237530685,proquest,10,LY,MB,n,NA (terrestrial?),y,soil attributes and organic carbon,NA,n,NA,connectivity
3,drought alters the biogeochemistry of boreal stream networks,"Drought is a global phenomenon, with widespread implications for freshwater ecosystems. While droughts receive much attention at lower latitudes, their effects on northern river networks remain unstudied. We combine a reach-scale manipulation experiment, observations during the extreme 2018 drought, and historical monitoring data to examine the impact of drought in northern boreal streams. Increased water residence time during drought promoted reductions in aerobic metabolism and increased concentrations of reduced solutes in both stream and hyporheic water. Likewise, data during the 2018 drought revealed widespread hypoxic conditions and shifts towards anaerobic metabolism, especially in headwaters. Finally, long-term data confirmed that past summer droughts have led to similar metabolic alterations. Our results highlight the potential for drought to promote biogeochemical shifts that trigger poor water quality conditions in boreal streams. Given projected increases in hydrological extremes at northern latitudes, the consequences of drought for the health of running waters warrant attention.","Gómez-Gener, Lluís;Lupon, Anna;Laudon, Hjalmar;Sponseller, Ryan A",Scholarly Journals,2020,11,2389689161,proquest,17,LY,MB,n,streams,y,aerobic metabolism and solute concentrations,water residence time,y,abstract doesn't include term connectivity directly,NA
4,"effects of hydrologic connectivity on water chemistry, soils, and vegetation structure and function in an intermontane depressional wetland landscape","Historically, depressional wetlands have been viewed as small, closed basins without a naturally integrated inter-wetland surface drainage system. In this view, landscape-level connectivity is limited to surface water as overland flow. Contrasting with this view, conceptual prairie pothole ground-water models have relied on ground-water connectivity to explain inter-wetland differences in salinity, duration of inundation, and vegetation structure. To help clarify this contrast, we compared differences in hydrology, ground-water connectivity, near-surface soil moisture, geomorphology, water chemistry, and vegetation community structure and productivity for a suite of depressional wetlands in an intermontane prairie of western Montana. We compared depressional wetlands with and without temporary (< 4 wk) surface-water and/or soil-water connections. Connected wetlands had significantly smaller catchments, but stored more water, stored water longer, and had higher specific conductance than did isolated wetlands. Connected wetlands also had higher net primary productivity and a different plant community composition than did isolated wetlands. Comparisons of study site hydrology, water chemistry, and soil development found strong evidence for no ground-water exchange among any of the wetlands. The absence of ground water connection among these intermontane depressional wetlands emphasizes the importance of temporary surface-water and soil-water connections in depressional wetland ecology, as well as the need to understand the landscape scale variation of dissolved solutes and the distribution, abundance, and productivity of wetland plants among depressional wetlands and across wetland landscapes.","Cook, B J;Richard Hauer, F",Scholarly Journals,2007,27,20867134,proquest,24,LY,PG,n,wetlands,y,"vegetative net primary productivity, among others",temporary (<4 wk) connected vs. not connected wetlands via surface and groundwater,y,temporary wetlands in intermontaine prairie,NA
5,hydrologic and biotic influences on nitrate removal in a subtropical spring-fed river,"We use a long-term chemical and hydrologic record in combination with longitudinal sampling and high-frequency nitrate (NO sub(3) super(-)) measurements from in situ sensors to describe temporal and spatial patterns of nitrogen (N) inputs and removal in the spring-fed Ichetucknee River (Columbia County, Florida) and to determine the hydrological, geomorphic, and biological factors that influence those dynamics. Over a 20-yr period of record, NO sub(3)-N removal averaged 118 kg N d super(-1) (0.77 g N m super(-2) d super(-1)) over the upper 5 km of the Ichetucknee River. Three independent estimates of gross autotrophicNassimilation (from gross primary production, diel NO sub(3) super(-) variation, and standing biomass) agreed closely but accounted for less than 20% of observed N removal. Longitudinal surveys indicate negligible or negative dissolved organic nitrogen and ammonium (NH sub(4) super(+)) production, suggesting that denitrification is the predominant mechanism of N removal in this river. A positive relationship between discharge and the magnitude of NO sub(3)-N removal shows that interactions with the surrounding floodplain exert considerable influence at high flows, and longitudinal NO sub(3) super(-) patterns indicate that N removal may be influenced by channel morphology. These results suggest a greater role for dissimilatory processes and hydrologic connectivity with hyporheic and floodplain sediments than has been previously recognized in highly productive spring-fed rivers of north Florida. While hydrologic variation is the primary determinant of variation in NO sub(3) super(-) removal within the Ichetucknee River, comparison across systems indicates that biotic characteristics can cause significant deviation from predictions based on purely physical models of relationships between river size and N removal.","Heffernan, James B;Cohen, Matthew J;Frazer, Thomas K;Thomas, Ray G;Rayfield, Travis J;Gulley, Jason;Martin, Jonathan B;Delfino, Joseph J;Graham, Wendy D",Scholarly Journals,2010,55,746163841,proquest,31,LY,MB,n,river-floodplain,y,forms of nitrogen (input and removal),discharge,y,NA,NA
6,incorporating ecological and evolutionary processes into continental-scale conservation planning,"Systematic conservation planning research has focused on designing systems of conservation areas that efficiently protect a comprehensive and representative set of species and habitats. Recently, there has been an emphasis on improving the adequacy of conservation area design to promote the persistence and future generation of biodiversity. Few studies have explored incorporating ecological and evolutionary processes into conservation planning assessments. Biodiversity in Australia is maintained and generated by numerous ecological and evolutionary processes at various spatial and temporal scales. We accommodated ecological and evolutionary processes in four ways: ( 1) using sub-catchments as planning units to facilitate the protection of the integrity and function of ecosystem processes occurring on a sub-catchment scale; ( 2) targeting one type of ecological refugia, drought refugia, which are critical for the persistence of many species during widespread drought; ( 3) targeting one type of evolutionary refugia which are important for maintaining and generating unique biota during long-term climatic changes; and ( 4) preferentially grouping priority areas along vegetated waterways to account for the importance of connected waterways and associated riparian areas in maintaining processes. We identified drought refugia, areas of relatively high and regular herbage production in arid and semiarid Australia, from estimates of gross primary productivity derived from satellite data. In this paper, we combined the novel incorporation of these processes with a more traditional framework of efficiently representing a comprehensive sample of biodiversity to identify spatial priorities across Australia. We explored the trade-offs between economic costs, representation targets, and connectivity. Priority areas that considered ecological and evolutionary processes were more connected along vegetated waterways and were identified for a small increase in economic cost. Priority areas for conservation investment are more likely to have long-term benefits to biodiversity if ecological and evolutionary processes are considered in their identification.","Klein, Carissa; Wilson, Kerrie; Watts, Matthew; Stein, Janet; Berry, Sandra; Carwardine, Josie; Smith, Mark Stafford; Mackey, Brendan; Possingham, Hugh P.",Scholarly Journals,2009,19,BIOSIS:PREV200900201044,wos,38,LY,DC,n,all?,y,biodiversity,vegetated waterways,y,satellite imagery analysis at landscape scale for conservation planning,NA
7,linkages among aquatic ecosystems,"Aquatic ecosystems are almost invariably connected to other ecosystems because the dominant force of water movement facilitates physical, chemical, and biological exchanges among ecosystems In this sense, we define an ecosystem linkage as any persistent or recurring process or attribute that connects different ecosystems in some manner. We argue that such linkages are integral, even defining, components of aquatic ecosystem structure and function, and therefore, Should be evaluated in the Course of ecological Studies J-NABS has made significant contributions to our understanding of such linkages The percentage of all publications in J-NABS addressing some ecological linkage has approached 10% in recent years. Historically, emphasis was placed on upstream-downstream linkages in flowing waters, and theory (e.g, river continuum, nutrient spiraling) has evolved largely around this phenomenon However, other linkages among ecosystems have received increased attention in the past 20 y These linkages include surface-subsurface, lake-stream, river-floodplain, and, more recently, marine-freshwater. We contend that many ecological processes, Including primary production, nutrient cycling, organic matter processing, and secondary production, are driven by Such exchanges because of the donor-controlled nature of many aquatic ecosystems Exchanges of materials from aquatic ecosystems to terrestrial systems, caused by flooding, nutrient translocation, or insect emergence, can be substantial Movement of energy and nutrients from the ocean to freshwaters, such as in the migrations of anadromous fishes, also can be dramatic Despite increasing evidence of the importance Of Such linkages, considerable impediments to research, Such as Journal specialization, lack of interdisciplinary study teams, and limited funding of sufficient duration for Such research, exist. Such obstacles are surmount able if investigators continue to emphasize that aquatic ecology will be advanced by the study of such linkages, and that environmental problems are better understood and solved in the context of that knowledge.","Lamberti, Gary A.; Chaloner, Dominic T.; Hershey, Anne E.",Scholarly Journals,2010,29,BIOSIS:PREV201000197689,wos,45,LY,PG,n,all?,n,"primary production, nutrient cycling, organic matter processing, and secondary production",linkages between ecosystem,n,could be interesting meta-analysis.

8,"nitrogen subsidies from hillslope alder stands to streamside wetlands and headwater streams, kenai peninsula, alaska","We examined nitrogen transport and wetland primary production along hydrologic flow paths that link nitrogen‐fixing alder ( Alnus spp.) stands to downslope wetlands and streams in the Kenai Lowlands, Alaska. We expected that nitrate concentrations in surface water and groundwater would be higher on flow paths below alder. We further expected that nitrate concentrations would be higher in surface water and groundwater at the base of short flow paths with alder and that streamside wetlands at the base of alder‐near flow paths would be less nitrogen limited than wetlands at the base of long flow paths with alder. Our results showed that groundwater nitrate‐N concentrations were significantly higher at alder‐near sites than at no‐alder sites, but did not differ significantly between alder‐far sites and no‐alder sites or between alder‐far sites and alder‐near sites. A survey of 15 N stable isotope signatures in soils and foliage in alder‐near and no‐alder flow paths indicated the alder‐derived nitrogen evident in soils below alder is quickly integrated downslope. Additionally, there was a significant difference in the relative increase in plant biomass after nitrogen fertilization, with the greatest increase occurring in the no‐alder sites. This study demonstrates that streamside wetlands and streams are connected to the surrounding landscapes through hydrologic flow paths, and flow paths with alder stands are potential “hot spots” for nitrogen subsidies at the hillslope scale.","Callahan, Michael K;Whigham, Dennis F;Rains, Mark C;Rains, Kai C;King, Ryan S;Walker, Coowe M;Maurer, Jasmine R;Baird, Steven J",Scholarly Journals,2017,53,2008908833,proquest,52,LY,DC,n,"wetlands, streams",y,"nitrate, plant biomass",upslope/downslope flow paths between streams/wetlands and alders,unsure,looking at nitrogen-fixation by alders ,
9,resilience to drought of dryland wetlands threatened by climate change,"Dryland wetlands are resilient ecosystems that can adapt to extreme periodic drought-flood episodes. Climate change projections show increased drought severity in drylands that could compromise wetland resilience and reduce important habitat services. These recognized risks have been difficult to evaluate due to our limited capacity to establish comprehensive relationships between flood-drought episodes and vegetation responses at the relevant spatiotemporal scales. We address this issue by integrating detailed spatiotemporal flood-drought simulations with remotely sensed vegetation responses to water regimes in a dryland wetland known for its highly variable inundation. We show that a combination of drought tolerance and dormancy strategies allow wetland vegetation to recover after droughts and recolonize areas invaded by terrestrial species. However, climate change scenarios show widespread degradation during drought and limited recovery after floods. Importantly, the combination of degradation extent and increase in drought duration is critical for the habitat services wetland systems provide for waterbirds and fish.","Sandi, Steven G;Rodriguez, Jose F;Saintilan, Neil;Wen, Li;Kuczera, George;Riccardi, Gerardo;Saco, Patricia M",Scholarly Journals,2020,10,2431814975,proquest,59,LY,DC,n,dryland wetland,y,vegetation (from remote sensing),inundated/not inundated,y,flood-drought simulations for climate change,NA
10,the danube restoration project: functional aspects and planktonic productivity in the floodplain system,"In Austria, the 'Danube Restoration Project' (DRP) was implemented to re-establish the connectivity between the Danube and its floodplain along a free flowing section downstream of Vienna. Before the restoration, the status quo of the 'Regelsbrunn' floodplain segment was investigated at different levels of abiotic, biotic and functional properties according to the spatio-temporal effects of hydrological connectivity. The present paper deals with temporal effects on hydrochemistry and on phyto- and bacterioplankton in the side channel (parapotamon). A hydrological situation of the present state of short-termed and intensive flood pulses followed by a period of isolation was compared with a period of higher connectivity reflecting the situation after the restoration. Rising water levels in the river, establishing local surface inflows, resulted in periodic nutrient pulses, high particle load and eutrophication in the floodplain. With disconnection after a spate, the nitrate and soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) concentration decreased significantly during 1 month. Phytoplankton correlated negatively with SRP during the first week after a flood pulse, reflecting the dominance of phytoplankton in SRP uptake. Planktonic primary production was stimulated by the nutrient import at higher connectivity and could be controlled by a decrease in retention time, related to the aims of the DRP. The two investigated periods indicated that increasing retention time in the side channel resulted in a shift from primary production towards prevailing bacterial secondary production.","Hein, T.; Heiler, G.; Pennetzdorfer, D.; Riedler, P.; Schagerl, M.; Schiemer, F.",Scholarly Journals,1999,15,BIOSIS:PREV199900238128,wos,66,LY,ES,n,river-floodplain,y,"hydrochemistry, phytoplankton, bacterioplankton",higher connectivity vs. flood-isolation,y,found shift from primary production to secondary bacterial production with increased retention time due to nutrient pulses (after restoration?),
11,trophic connectivity and basal food sources sustaining tropical aquatic consumers along a mangrove to ocean gradient,"Variations in the relative importance of autotrophic sources to aquatic consumers along environmental gradients and the trophic role of mangrove-derived detritus to marine coastal food webs are still poorly investigated in tropical systems. In this study, we employed stable isotope analyses to investigate the relative importance of basal food sources to macroconsumers (decapod crustaceans and fishes) in a tropical estuary along an environmental gradient extending from the mangroves to the ocean. Additionally, we evaluated the 'outwelling hypothesis', which hypothesizes that mangrove-derived detritus exported to the adjacent marine area is a food source for marine macroconsumers at open and reef-protected sandy beaches. Primary producers and macroconsumers (62 and 214 samples, respectively) were collected at five locations across the main longitudinal axis of the Mamanguape estuary, a tropical Southwestern Atlantic estuary. There were marked shifts in carbon and nitrogen isotope values for both food sources and consumers along the estuarine-marine gradient, and the mixing model results revealed similar patterns of assimilation of basal food sources by decapod crustaceans and fishes. In the inner section of the estuary, consumers tended to assimilated nutrients derived mainly from mangrove and macroalgae, whereas nearer the mouth of the estuary and in the adjacent marine area they assimilated nutrients derived mainly from macroalgae, seagrass and organic matter in the sediment (SOM). These findings support the hypothesis that the relative importance of basal food sources to macroconsumers in this tropical estuarine system reflects the dominant autochthonous primary production at each location. In contrast, our results did not support the outwelling hypothesis that mangrove-originated detritus, in the form of senescent mangrove leaves, makes a significant contribution as a primary source of carbon to high-order consumers inhabiting adjacent ocean sandy beaches.","Claudino, Marlucy Coelho;Pessanha, Andre Luiz Machado;Araujo, Francisco Gerson;Garcia, Alexandre Miranda",Scholarly Journals,2015,167,1753464381,proquest,73,LY,DC,y,marine,y,"basal food sources (detritus, macroalgae, etc)",isotope signatures ,n,NA,marine
61,"refining the 'pulse-reserve' model for arid central australia: seasonal rainfall, soil moisture and plant productivity in sand ridge and stony plain habitats of the simpson desert","In dry ecosystems, water supply is highly variable in time and space, occurring either as short pulses of shallow soil water or long phases of deep soil water. There may be correspondence between hierarchical soil water pulses and hierarchical biological responses, but this has not been directly tested for arid Australia. We compared plant community responses to an isolated short rain pulse (about 130mm, November 2008) versus the start, mid and later stages of an extended high rainfall phase (about 540mm, February 2010 to March 2011) at a site on the western edge of the Simpson Desert. We sampled across contrasting habitats: tall longitudinal sand ridges and adjacent stony clay plains (gibber). Thus, we compared responses to spatially variable soil moisture availability (sand vs. clay soil; run-off/on relief) and temporally variable rainfall supply. Our results supported the hierarchical resource pulse-biological response concept for dry ecosystems, with the short and long rainfall phases modulating distinct responses among functional types. Shallow-rooted annual grasses showed an equivalent positive response to the isolated pulse as to the first pulse of the high rain phase; whereas short-lived forbs, longer-lived (2-3 years) grasses and persistent forbs had peak abundance during the high rainfall phase. Perennial grass and shrub productivity did not change over time, though there was a distinct trend towards heightened sexual reproduction at the mid-late stages of the high rain phase. We also found that species seasonal growth tendencies were pronounced, and that spatial aspects of moisture availability resulted in different composition patterns at the habitat scale with the gibber and sand ridge sites showing strong and weak correspondence with temporal rainfall patterning respectively. Thus, we confirm that plant productivity models for this region should include the effects of rainfall connectivity and soil texture as well as species seasonal growth constraints and rooting attributes.","Nano, Catherine E.

46,"limnophase versus potamophase: how hydrological connectivity affects the zooplankton community in an oxbow lake (vistula river, poland)","The functioning of oxbow lakes depends primarily on the succession of two phases: potamophase (when water from the river flows into the lake) and limnophase (when water remains in the riverbed, ensuring stability in the lake). Hydrologic conditions in the river determine whether oxbows are isolated or connected with the river. They also determine the time and duration of both phases. The studied oxbow lake, located in the floodplain of the lower Vistula, was created as the result of river regulation in the 19th century. Observations were conducted during growing seasons in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2013, during limnophase and potamophase. The study was aimed at evaluating the impact of changes in the river level on the oxbow lake. Potamophase brought greater zooplankton diversity. We recorded a higher number of species and a higher Shannon diversity index ( H ′). During limnophase, higher water temperature led to greater zooplankton density. However, its diversity decreased. In recent years, probably due to climate change, the amount of precipitation has decreased. As a result, water levels in rivers are lower and potamophase is rare, while periods of isolation are longer. Low water levels in oxbows increase their primary productivity and decrease zooplankton biodiversity.","Napiórkowski, Paweł;Napiórkowska, Teresa",Scholarly Journals,2017,53,2196538034,proquest,44,CP,LY,NA,oxbow lakes,NA,zooplankton diversity and density,lakes isolated from (limnophase) or connected to  river (potamophase),y,,
