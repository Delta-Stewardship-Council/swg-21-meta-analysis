1,the performance of ecological cage aquaculture of pejerrey odontesthes bonariensis in pampean lakes under two different hydrological scenarios,"Ecological aquaculture promotes the development of sustainable farming systems, focusing on a wide range of ecosystem elements. The ecological aquaculture of the zooplanktivorous pejerrey ( Odontesthes bonariensis ) in floating cages in Pampean shallow lakes (Argentina) needs to be carried out considering the hydrological and chemical variations as modulators of plankton community and consequently of the pejerrey yield. To assess its performance in lakes with contrasting hydrological regimes, an experiment was carried out in two water bodies: La Salada de Monasterio Lake (Mon), an endorheic environment, and San Lorenzo Lake (Lor), connected to several lakes and the Salado River. During the experiment, regional rainfall generated high hydrological variability in Lor Lake changing its status of unconnected lake to a run‐of‐the‐river lake. High standard deviation in Chlorophyll‐a values in Lor indicated the significant effects of hydrological instability on the plankton community. Microcrustaceans abundance and biomass were higher in Mon, and almost disappeared in Lor when it turns into run‐of‐the‐river. The final fish growth and survival were significantly higher in Mon, endorsing the importance of zooplankton of high nutritional quality and hydrological, physical–chemical and biological stability. The results indicate that productive and stable environments with a sustained offer of natural food are better for the zooplanktivorous fish production. Connectivity with other water bodies and hydrological dependence on rainfall regimes have defining effects on phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish production, thus emerging as key factors to be considered for achieving better results in the ecological aquaculture implementation.","Javier R Garcia de Souza;Moreno, Vivian Yorojo;Sathicq, María B;Gómez, Nora;Sampietro, Susana;Donadelli, Jorge;Colautti, Darío C",Scholarly Journals,2021,52,2572363494,proquest,MB,RP,n,lake,y,"chlorophyll a, microcrustacean abundance and biomass, fish growth and survival",connected/not connected,y,"Included because paper describes the impact of changes in hydrologic connectivity on phytoplankton and the food web (zooplankton, fish)."

3,do environmental variables predict the trophic structure of fish fauna in a subtropical river (uruguay river ecoregion)?,"Trophic interactions represent the routes through which energy flows upwards within ecosystems and the understanding of such structuring under varying environmental conditions is still challenging. Here we test the hypothesis that differences in environmental variables act as environmental filters on the composition and trophic structure of local the fish fauna of a subtropical mountain river. We predict that differences in the trophic structure of the fish fauna occur along the river continuum. Main environmental parameters have been measured and fishes were sampled quarterly between August 2013 and May 2014 at six sampling sites in the main channel of the Pelotas River, Upper Uruguay ecoregion. We collected 3848 individuals belonging to 38 species, 4 orders and 11 families. The most (82.1%) consisted of small- and medium-sized individuals. The species were classified into eight trophic guilds: aquatic insectivorous, carnivorous, detritivorous, detritivorous/aquatic insectivorous, herbivorous, iliophagous, omnivorous and piscivorous. In general, herbivorous and piscivorous guilds were the most representative in both number and biomass. Significant differences detected by Permanova were for richness, numerical abundance and biomass between all the sites sampled. Relationships between the environmental variables and the composition of trophic guilds were observed along the longitudinal gradient by RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. The abundance of guilds omnivorous, aquatic insectivorous and herbivorous increases with higher values of chlorophyll- a and vegetation cover, especially characterizing the upstream sites (S1, S2 and S3). On the other hand, the abundance of the iliophagous, detritivorous/insectivorous and piscivorous guilds increases with greater values of width, temperature, inorganic phosphorus and total solids, a fact observed in downstream sites (S4, S5 and S6). Thus, it was possible to identify a clear variation in the trophic structure of the fish fauna along the Pelotas River (upstream-downstream), in which the local variables were efficient in predicting environmental filters that influence the trophic organization. In this scenario, our study follows the longitudinal model and evidences a greater accumulation of energy in food webs in the upstream-downstream direction, which favors the greatest abundance of piscivorous, detritivorous and iliophagous verified in stretches of greater volume and dimensions of river. These results highlight the importance of the local variables and the interrelationships in the lateral connectivity processes along the river continuum.","Neves, Mayara P;Baumgartner, Dirceu;Baumgartner, Gilmar;Delariva, Rosilene L",Scholarly Journals,2018,77,2417690740,proquest,MB,DC,n,river,y,"fish abundance, richness, biomass, and composition of trophic guilds",none,n,"Excluded because abstract does not describe a measure of connectivity or an anlysis of the impact of conntectivity.

4,hydrological pulse regulating the bacterial heterotrophic metabolism between amazonian mainstems and floodplain lakes,"We evaluated in situ rates of bacterial carbon processing in Amazonian floodplain lakes and mainstems, during both high water (HW) and low water (LW) phases (p &lt; 0.05). Our results showed that bacterial production (BP) was lower and more variable than bacterial respiration, determined as total respiration. Bacterial carbon demand was mostly accounted by BR and presented the same pattern that BR in both water phases. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) showed a wide range (0.2-23%) and low mean value of 3 and 6%, (in HW and LW, respectively) suggesting that dissolved organic carbon was mostly allocated to catabolic metabolism. However, BGE was regulated by BP in LW phase. Consequently, changes in BGE showed the same pattern that BP. In addition, the hydrological pulse effects on mainstems and floodplains lakes connectivity were found for BP and BGE in LW. Multiple correlation analyses revealed that indexes of organic matter (OM) quality (chlorophyll-a, N stable isotopes and C/N ratios) were the strongest seasonal drivers of bacterial carbon metabolism. Our work indicated that: (i) the bacterial metabolism was mostly driven by respiration in Amazonian aquatic ecosystems resulting in low BGE in either high or LW phase; (ii) the hydrological pulse regulated the bacterial heterotrophic metabolism between Amazonian mainstems and floodplain lakes mostly driven by OM quality.","Vidal, Luciana O;Abril, Gwenäel;Artigas, Luiz F;Melo, Michaela L;Bernardes, Marcelo C;Lobão, Lúcia M;Reis, Mariana C;Moreira-Turcq, Patrícia;Benedetti, Marc;Tornisielo, Valdemar L;Roland, Fabio",Scholarly Journals,2015,6,1725025157,proquest,MB,RP,n,floodplain lakes and mainstems,y,"bacterial carbon processing: bacterial production, bacterial respiration, bacterial growth efficiency ",high water/low water phases,unsure,"Paper does examine the impacts of different water phases, but is bacterial processing a response variable of interest for our purposes?"
5,abundance and biomass responses of microbial food web components to hydrology and environmental gradients within a floodplain of the river danube,"This study investigated the relationships of time-dependent hydrological variability and selected microbial food web components. Samples were collected monthly from the Kopački Rit floodplain in Croatia, over a period of 19 months, for analysis of bacterioplankton abundance, cell size and biomass; abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and nanophytoplankton; and concentration of chlorophyll a. Similar hydrological variability at different times of the year enabled partition of seasonal effects from hydrological changes on microbial community properties. The results suggested that, unlike some other studies investigating sites with different connectivity, bacterioplankton abundance, and phytoplankton abundance and biomass increased during lentic conditions. At increasing water level, nanophytoplankton showed lower sensitivity to disturbance in comparison with total phytoplankton biomass: this could prolong autotrophic conditions within the floodplain. Bacterioplankton biomass, unlike phytoplankton, was not impacted by hydrology. The bacterial biomass less affected by hydrological changes can be an important additional food component for the floodplain food web. The results also suggested a mechanism controlling bacterial cell size independent of hydrology, as bacterial cell size was significantly decreased as nanoflagellate abundance increased. Hydrology, regardless of seasonal sucession, has the potential to structure microbial food webs, supporting microbial development during lentic conditions. Conversely, other components appear unaffected by hydrology or may be more strongly controlled by biotic interactions. This research, therefore, adds to understanding on microbial food web interactions in the context of flood and flow pulses in river-floodplain ecosystems.","Palijan, Goran",Scholarly Journals,2012,64,1400127912,proquest,MB,PG,n,floodplain,y,"bacterioplankton abundance, size, and biomass; abundance of nanoflaggellates and nanophytoplankton; concentration of cholorphyll a",unclear; water level,unsure,"The information in the abstract does not seem directly relevant (no clear connectivity metric, focus on microbial community), but mentions measuring chlorophyll a, so maybe worth looking at full text"
6,spatial variability of zooplankton along a section of river sio under different habitat conditions,"Many factors influence the abundance and species richness of zooplankton in river systems, including river hydrology, morphology, phytoplankton development and biotic interactions. River Sio discharges into Lake Victoria and forms a boundary between Kenya and Uganda at its middle and lower reaches. The river has an average discharge of 11.4 m3s-1 contributing 1.5% of riverine water input into Lake Victoria. Zooplankton community studies were carried out along a section of River Sio and its floodplain on the Ugandan side between November 2008 and January 2009. The main focus of the study was that River Sio zooplankton diversity; biomass and abundance patterns were expected to change with differing levels of lateral connectivity and habitat heterogeneity of the river plus its floodplain. Sampling along lateral and longitudinal transects of the river were done to investigate the effect of habitat heterogeneity subject to the river's flooding regimes on the abundance, composition and diversity of its zooplankton. Zooplankton samples were collected using a zooplankton net of mesh size 60/lm and a Schindler trap sampler for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Other factors determined were selected physico-chemical variables. Zooplankton and physical-chemical data were subjected to statistical analyses (ANOVA, multivariate, regression and correlation analyses) for significant tests after log transformation. The ordination of samples (sites and dates) of physical-chemical or biological variables was carried out using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Similarity and diversity indices were used to assess structural patterns. In total, 45 rotifer, 9 copepod and 7 cladocera species were identified. Mean zooplankton density and biomass of River Sio were lower in the main channel of the river compared to its floodplain sites. Significant habitat differences were observed for zooplankton composition and abundance but no seasonal biomass and density differences were identified. Nutrient levels of River Sio were found to be very low. Physicalchemical factors like chlorophyll-a showed strong influences on the zooplankton community structure. These findings suggest that both low and high river water levels and the availability of heterogeneous habitats are crucial for zooplankton development in River Sio. The high zooplankton density observed bears significance to the ecological functions of the river as a breeding and nursery ground for potamodromous fishes from Lake Victoria.","Gimbo, R",Books,2009,NA,968183622,proquest,MB,LY,n,river and floodplain,y,zooplankton community,"unclear; water level, lateral connectivity",y,"Describes the impact of floodplain innundation on zooplankton.

7,"hydrological connectivity, and the exchange of organic matter and nutrients in a dynamic river-floodplain system (danube, austria)","1. The relationship between hydrological connectivity, and the exchange processes of suspended sediments, organic matter and nutrients (NO sub(3)-N) was investigated in a dynamically connected river-floodplain segment of the Danube over a 15-month period in 1995 and 1996 in the Alluvial Zone National Park, Austria. 2. Based on water level dynamics and water retention times, three phases of river-floodplain connectivity were identified: disconnection (phase I), seepage inflow (phase II) and upstream surface connection (phase III). The frequency of occurrence of these phases was 67.5%, 29.3% and 3.2%, respectively, during the study period. 3. A conceptual model is presented linking hydrological connectivity with ecological processes. Generally, the floodplain shifts from a closed and mainly biologically controlled ecosystem during phase I to an increasingly open and more hydrologically controlled system during phases II and III. Phase I, with internal processes dominating, is designated the 'biotic interaction phase'. 4. Phase II, with massive nutrient inputs to the floodplain yet relatively high residence times, and therefore, high algal biomass, is classified as the 'primary production phase'. This demonstrates that water level fluctuations well below bankfull may considerably enhance floodplain productivity. 5. Finally, since transport of particulate matter is mainly restricted to short flood pulses above bankfull level, phase III has been defined as the 'transport phase'. 6. The floodplain served as a major sink for suspended sediments (250 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)), FPOM (96 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)), particulate organic carbon (POC; 2.9 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)) and nitrate-nitrogen (0.96 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)), but was a source for dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 240 kg ha super(-1) year super(-1)), algal biomass (chlorophyll-a; 0.5 kg ha super(-1) year super(-1)) and CPOM (21 kg ha super(-1) year super(-1)). Considerable quantities of DOC and algal biomass were exported to the river channel during phase II, whereas particulate matter transport was largely restricted to the short floods of phase III. 7. The Danube Restoration Project will create a more gradual change between the individual phases by increasing hydrological connectivity between the river channel and the floodplain, and is predicted to enhance productivity by maintaining a balance between retention and export of nutrients and organic matter.","Tockner, K;Pennetzdorfer, D;Reiner, N;Schiemer, F;Ward, J V",Scholarly Journals,1999,41,17380345,proquest,MB,DC,n,river and floodplain,y,"algal biomass, dissolved organic carbon, CPOM, suspended sediments","categorized into three phases: disconnection, seepage inflow, upstream surface connection",y,Provides a potentially useful connectivity classification system and describes transport between floodplain and river

9,"microcrustacean (cladocera, copepoda, ostracoda) diversity in three side arms in the gemenc floodplain (danube river, hungary) in different hydrological situations","The microcrustacean assemblages, from different functional units of the Gemenc Floodplain (Danube River), were studied in various hydrological situations between 2002 and 2009. Sixty-three microcrustacean taxa were recorded from which 38 belonged to Cladocera, 18 to Copepoda and seven to Ostracoda. Among them there were some rare for the Middle Danube Region species, such as Dunhevedia crassa King, 1853, Holopedium gibberum Zaddach, 1855, Monospilus dispar (Sars, 1862). Significant differences were found between the different functional units of the floodplain focusing on the examined parameters of the microcrustacean assemblages. The most important factors influencing the species richness, as well as the density and diversity patterns of the assemblages, were the occurrence of flow, the connectivity with the main arm and the hydrological distance from the main arm. Most of these environmental factors are determined by the water level fluctuations of the Danube River which showed a negative correlation with all the examined parameters of the zooplankton assemblages. The density of the communities in both side arms correlated positively with the chlorophyll-a concentration. Moreover, the microcrustacean abundance showed an inverse relationship with the temperature but not in all of the side arms.","Kiss, Anita; Agoston-Szabo, Edit; Dinka, Maria; Schoell, Karoly; Berczik, Arpad",Scholarly Journals,2014,NA,BIOSIS:PREV201400560928,wos,MB,DC,n,floodplain,y,microcrustacean assemblage,connected/not connected; hydrological distance to main arm,y,"describes the impact of floodplain connectivity on zooplankton assemblage.

10,aquatic metabolism short-term response to the flood pulse in a mediterranean floodplain,"The pulsing of river discharge affects biodiversity and productivity of whole river-floodplain ecosystems, triggering the transport, storage and processing of carbon. In this study we investigate the short-term changes in water chemistry and net pelagic metabolism (NEP) in two floodplain lakes in response to a flood pulse. The two oxbow lakes investigated in the floodplain of the Mediterranean Ebro River (NE Spain) showed a clear temporal shift in their metabolic balance, controlled by the river discharge and associated changes in water physical and chemical characteristics. Water chemistry (turbidity, water organic matter, chlorophyll a and nutrients concentration) returned to pre-flood values after 4 days, highlighting the resilience of the ecosystem to flood pulses. Lake NEP was depressed before and during floods to a minimum of -34 mg O-2 m(-3) h(-1), and increased after the flood pulse to a maximum of +463 mg O-2 m(-3) h(-1). The phytoplankton assemblage showed before and after floods a replacement of autotrophic species (e.g. Chlorophyceans) by mixotrophic organisms (e.g. Cryptophyceans, Euglenoids). A linear mixed effects model identified abiotic factors, particularly temperature and river discharge, as significant predictors of the net aquatic metabolism and community respiration during flood conditions. Our results suggest that the role of the Ebro floodplain lakes as sources or sinks of C is complex and relative to the time scale investigated, depending strongly on the river discharge dynamics and the transport of limiting nutrients (phosphorus).","Gallardo, B.; Espanol, C.; Comin, F.

11,the lake-catchment (lakecat) dataset: characterizing landscape features for lake basins within the conterminous usa,"Natural and human-related landscape features influence the ecology and water quality of lakes. Summarizing these features in a hydrologically meaningful way is critical to understanding and managing lake ecosystems. Such summaries are often done by delineating watershed boundaries of individual lakes. However, many technical challenges are associated with delineating hundreds or thousands of lake watersheds at broad spatial extents. These challenges can limit the application of analyses and models to new, unsampled locations. We present the Lake-Catchment (LakeCat) Dataset (https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/lakecat) of watershed features for 378,088 lakes within the conterminous USA. We describe the methods we used to: 1) delineate lake catchments, 2) hydrologically connect nested lake catchments, and 3) generate several hundred watershed-level metrics that summarize both natural (e.g., soils, geology, climate, and land cover) and anthropogenic (e.g., urbanization, agriculture, and mines) features. We illustrate how this data set can be used with a random forest model to predict the probability of lake eutrophication by combining LakeCat with data from US Environmental Protection Agency's National Lakes Assessment (NLA). This model correctly predicted the trophic state of 72% of NLA lakes, and we applied the model to predict the probability of eutrophication at 297,071 unsampled lakes across the conterminous USA. The large suite of LakeCat metrics could be used to improve analyses of lakes at broad spatial extents, improve the applicability of analyses to unsampled lakes, and ultimately improve the management of these important ecosystems.","Hill, Ryan A.; Weber, Marc H.; Debbout, Rick M.; Leibowitz, Scott G.; Olsen, Anthony R.",Scholarly Journals,2018,37,BIOSIS:PREV201800492376,wos,MB,CP,n,lakes,y,prabability of lake eutrophication,none,n,"Not relevant, does not address connectivity"
12,granal stacking of thylakoid membranes in higher plant chloroplasts: the physicochemical forces at work and the functional consequences that ensue,"The formation of grana in chloroplasts of higher plants is examined in terms of the subtle interplay of physicochemical forces of attraction and repulsion. The attractive forces between two adjacent membranes comprise (1) van der Waals attraction that depends on the abundance and type of atoms in each membrane, on the distance between the membranes and on the dielectric constant, (2) depletion attraction that generates local order by granal stacking at the expense of greater disorder (i.e. entropy) in the stroma, and (3) an electrostatic attraction of opposite charges located on adjacent membranes. The repulsive forces comprise (1) electrostatic repulsion due to the net negative charge on the outer surface of thylakoid membranes, (2) hydration repulsion that operates at small separations between thylakoid membranes due to layers of bound water molecules, and (3) steric hindrance due to bulky protrusions of Photosystem I (PSI) and ATP synthase into the stroma. In addition, specific interactions may occur, but they await experimental demonstration. Although grana are not essential for photosynthesis, they are ubiquitous in higher plants. Grana may have been selected during evolution for the functional advantages that they confer on higher plants. The functional consequences of grana stacking include (1) enhancement of light capture through a vastly increased area-to-volume ratio and connectivity of several PSIIs with large functional antenna size, (2) the ability to control the lateral separation of PSI from PSII and, therefore, the balanced distribution of excitation energy between two photosystems working in series, (3) the reversible fine-tuning of energy distribution between the photosystems by State 1-State 2 transitions, (4) the ability to regulate light-harvesting via controlled thermal dissipation of excess excitation energy, detected as non-photochemical quenching, (5) dynamic flexibility in the light reactions mediated by a granal structure in response to regulation by a trans-thylakoid pH gradient, (6) delaying the premature degradation of D1 and D2 reaction-centre protein(s) in PSII by harbouring photoinactived PSIIs in appressed granal domains, (7) enhancement of the rate of non-cyclic synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as well as the regulation of non-cyclic vs. cyclic ATP synthesis, and (8) the potential increase of photosynthetic capacity for a given composition of chloroplast constituents in full sunlight, concomitantly with enhancement of photochemical efficiency in canopy shade. Hence chloroplast ultrastructure and function are intimately intertwined.","Chow, Wah Soon; Kim, Eun-Ha; Horton, Peter; Anderson, Jan M.",Scholarly Journals,2005,4,BIOSIS:PREV200600205047,wos,MB,PG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,n,"Not relevant, about chloroplasts"
125,spatial distribution of nutrient limitation in the danube river floodplain in relation to hydrological connectivity,"In this paper, we describe the influence of flooding on nutrient conditions and phytoplankton Chl-a concentrations in a hydrologically dynamic Danube floodplain in North-Eastern Croatia. Based on hydrological typology, the connectivity gradient extends from the main river stream (Eupotamal) to the backwater channels and side-arms (Parapotamal) to the edge of the floodplain (Paleopotamal). A spatial gradient of phytoplankton Chl-a occurred during low water levels, while uniformity of Chl-a across wetland habitats was observed during high water levels. Nutrient enrichment assays indicated that inorganic nutrients in Eupotamal waters (N/P ratio 16-22) could support a higher growth rate of the assay alga Chlorella kessleri, while potential N limitation was found in Parapotamal and Paleopotamal waters (both with N/P ratios< 14). Spatial expansion of N limitation toward the main river was observed as inundation continued. Lateral flood pulse connectivity along with the duration of inundation period affects the input and the retention of nutrients, especially of nitrogen. Understanding of the relationship between spatial (location of the floodplain waterbodies regarding the river) and temporal (hydrological connectivity between the river and its floodplain) dimensions contribute to the importance of healthy floodplains for the maintenance of water quality and environmental conditions in the Danube River.","Persic, Vesna; Horvatic, Janja",Scholarly Journals,2011,31,BIOSIS:PREV201100752041,wos,RP,MB,n,floodplain,y,nutrients; chlorophyll a,"unclear; water level, duration of innundation",y,"Describes the impact of floodplain inundation on chlorophyll a.

In this chapter, we have assessed the influence of hydrological connectivity with the main channel on the trophic state and water quality in the Lake Sakadas. The evaluation of trophic state combines a number of physical, chemical and biological parameters with the objective to select the relevant indicators for the floodplain lakes. The following environmental parameters have been considered: water temperature, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, water transparency, chlorophyll-a concentration, phytoplankton primary productivity, benthic and periphytic communities and laboratory experiments (nutrient enrichment bioassay). An integrative approach, which includes in situ research and laboratory experiments, indicated strong correlations of abiotic and biotic components with a hydrological regime. Also, during the biological monitoring, occurrence and spread of invasive species was noted as an indication of ecosystem disturbance (hydrological and/or anthropogenic). Therefore, our results contribute to the perception of importance of the hydrological connectivity (by inundation) on the eutrophication process in the investigated floodplain lake.","Persic, Vesna; Cerba, Dubravka; Bogut, Irella; Horvatic, Janja",Books,2011,NA,BIOSIS:PREV201100325239,wos,RP,MB,n,floodplain lake,y,"""trophic state"" (a combination of parameters, including chlorophyll a)",unclear; connected/not connected,y,"Potential if the cholorphyll a data is available separate from the aggregated ""trophic state"" metric, look at full text to determine."
