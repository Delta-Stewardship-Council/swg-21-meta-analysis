Cold comfort: Arctic seabirds find refugia from climate change and potential competition in marginal ice zones and fjords.,"Climate change alters species distributions by shifting their fundamental niche in space through time. Such effects may be exacerbated by increased inter-specific competition if climate alters species dominance where competitor ranges overlap. This study used census data, telemetry and stable isotopes to examine the population and foraging ecology of a pair of Arctic and temperate congeners across an extensive zone of sympatry in Iceland, where sea temperatures varied substantially. The abundance of Arctic Brünnich's guillemot Uria lomvia declined with sea temperature. Accessibility of refugia in cold water currents or fjords helped support higher numbers and reduce rates of population decline. Competition with temperate Common guillemots Uria aalge did not affect abundance, but similarities in foraging ecology were sufficient to cause competition when resources are limiting. Continued warming is likely to lead to further declines of Brünnich's guillemot, with implications for conservation status and ecosystem services.",2595555040, 34751933,Scholarly Journals,,"Bonnet-Lebrun, Anne-Sophie;Larsen, Thomas;Thórarinsson, Thorkell Lindberg;Kolbeinsson, Yann;Frederiksen, Morten;Morley, Tim I;Fox, Derren;Boutet, Aude;le Bouard, Fabrice;Deville, Tanguy;Hansen, Erpur Snær;Hansen, Thomas;Roberts, Patrick;Ratcliffe, Norman",,,," Bonnet-Lebrun, Anne-Sophie",, 2021-11-09, 2021-11-09, 10.1007/s13280-021-01650-7, Journal Article, 1654-7209, 2021-11-09," November 9, 2021"," NE/R012660/1 , Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 03V01459", National Library of Medicine,,, English, English, PUBLISHER,,,"November 9, 2021",Ambio, CSAPTjournals,2021, Sweden,,,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/cold-comfort-arctic-seabirds-find-refugia-climate/docview/2595555040/se-2?accountid=14505," Ambio, November 9, 2021, ",,,,,,," Cited By:<br/>

Bird rookery nutrient over-enrichment as a potential accelerant of mangrove cay decline in Belize.,"Coastal eutrophication is an issue of serious global concern and although nutrient subsidies can enhance primary productivity of coastal wetlands, they can be detrimental to their long-term maintenance. By supplying nutrients to coastal ecosystems at levels comparable to intensive agriculture practices, roosting colonial waterbirds provide a natural experimental design to examine the impacts of anthropogenic nutrient enrichment in these systems. We tested the hypothesis that long-term nutrient enrichment from bird guano deposition is linked to declines in island size, which may subsequently decrease the stability and resilience of mangrove cays in Belize. We combined remote sensing analysis with field- and lab-based measurements of forest structure, sediment nutrients, and porewater nutrients on three pairs of rookery and control cays in northern, central, and southern Belize. Our results indicate that rookery cays are disappearing approximately 13 times faster than cays without seasonal or resident seabird populations. Rookery cays were associated with a significantly higher concentration of nitrogen (N) in mangrove leaves and greater aboveground biomass, suggesting that eutrophication from bird guano contributes to increased aboveground productivity. Sediments of rookery cays also had lower percentages of soil organic matter and total N and carbon (C) than control islands, which suggests that eutrophication accelerates organic matter decomposition resulting in lower total C stocks on rookery cays. Our results indicate that coastal eutrophication can reduce ecosystem stability by contributing to accelerated cay loss, with potential consequences for mangrove resilience to environmental variability under contemporary and future climatic scenarios.",2580694638, 34626271,Scholarly Journals,,"Simpson, L T;Canty, S W J;Cissell, J R;Steinberg, M K;Cherry, J A;Feller, I C",,,," Simpson, L T", 2021-11-15, 2021-10-09, 2021-11-15, 10.1007/s00442-021-05056-w, Journal Article, 1432-1939, 2021-10-09, November 2021,, National Library of Medicine,,3, English, English, MEDLINE, 771-784,,November 2021,Oecologia, CSAPTjournals,2021, Germany,,197,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/bird-rookery-nutrient-over-enrichment-as/docview/2580694638/se-2?accountid=14505," Oecologia, November 2021, 197(3):771-784",,,,,,," Cited By:<br/>

"Water level as the key controlling regulator associated with nutrient and gross primary productivity changes in a large floodplain-lake system (Lake Poyang), China","A floodplain lake system can be described as a water conveyance-type lake system that is subject to high water-level fluctuations (WLFs). This study investigated the effects of WLF on the nutrient status and the gross primary productivity (GPP) of phytoplankton in Lake Poyang, a large floodplain-lake system in China. This study hypothesized that WLF is the key controlling regulator of the lake’s nutrient status, phytoplankton growth and GPP, driven by its influence on the lake’s hydrological connectivity in combination with water-flow velocity as well as other environmental parameters. The results showed that the intra-annual water levels in this lake varied from 7.61 m to 20.82 m while inter-annual water levels significantly decreased throughout 1989–2018 (P &lt; 0.05). Except for pH, most environmental variables and nutrients differed significantly each season. Mean GPP and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration during the water rising period was clearly higher compared to the dry season, wet season and falling period. Moreover, nutrient concentration was the main determining factor of phytoplankton growth and GPP during different periods, while water temperature (WT) also played a key role in influencing phytoplankton biomass and GPP during the water rising period. There was also a direct correlation between WLF and GPP during the water rising period, and WLF significantly affected nutrient concentration, subsequently impacting GPP. This study can benefit our overall knowledge of hydrological and ecological dynamics in floodplain-lake systems, while providing an important reference for policymakers in the management of dams and water quality in floodplain-lake systems globally.",2574374455, IND607363166,Scholarly Journals," Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China","Wang, Shuoyue;Gao, Yang;Jia, Junjie;Kun, Sun;Lyu, Sidan;Li, Zhaoxi;Lu, Yao;Wen, Xuefa",,,," Wang, Shuoyue , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China",,,, 10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126414, Journal Article,,, Aug 2021,,,0022-1694,, English, English,,,,Aug 2021,Journal of hydrology, CSAPTjournals,2021, Elsevier B.V.," National Agricultural Library, © Elsevier B.V.",599,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/water-level-as-key-controlling-regulator/docview/2574374455/se-2?accountid=14505," Journal of hydrology, 2021 Aug., v. 599, Elsevier B.V., 0022-1694",,,,,,," Journal of hydrology. 2021 Aug., v. 599 Elsevier B.V. , NAL-AP-2-clean , Available from publisher's site",,,," biomass , chlorophyll , dry season , floodplains , gross primary productivity , lakes , nutrient content , pH , phytoplankton , water flow , water quality , water temperature , wet season , China , China"," article , Water level , Primary productivity , Floodplain , Lake Poyang , article",,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Water+level+as+the+key+controlling+regulator+associated+with+nutrient+and+gross+primary+productivity+changes+in+a+large+floodplain-lake+system+%28Lake+Poyang%29%2C+China&amp;author=Wang%2C+Shuoyue%3BGao%2C+Yang%3BJia%2C+Junjie%3BKun%2C+Sun%3BLyu%2C+Sidan%3BLi%2C+Zhaoxi%3BLu%2C+Yao%3BWen%2C+Xuefa&amp;volume=599&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2021&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+hydrology&amp;issn=0022-1694&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagricolamodule_IND607363166,Natural Science Collection
"Dam builders and their works: Beaver influences on the structure and function of river corridor hydrology, geomorphology, biogeochemistry and ecosystems","Beavers (Castor fiber, Castor canadensis) are one of the most influential mammalian ecosystem engineers, heavily modifying river corridor hydrology, geomorphology, nutrient cycling, and ecosystems. As an agent of disturbance, they achieve this first and foremost through dam construction, which impounds flow and increases the extent of open water, and from which all other landscape and ecosystem impacts follow. After a long period of local and regional eradication, beaver populations have been recovering and expanding throughout Europe and North America, as well as an introduced species in South America, prompting a need to comprehensively review the current state of knowledge on how beavers influence the structure and function of river corridors. Here, we synthesize the overall impacts on hydrology, geomorphology, biogeochemistry, and aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Our key findings are that a complex of beaver dams can increase surface and subsurface water storage, modify the reach scale partitioning of water budgets, allow site specific flood attenuation, alter low flow hydrology, increase evaporation, increase water and nutrient residence times, increase geomorphic heterogeneity, delay sediment transport, increase carbon, nutrient and sediment storage, expand the extent of anaerobic conditions and interfaces, increase the downstream export of dissolved organic carbon and ammonium, decrease the downstream export of nitrate, increase lotic to lentic habitat transitions and aquatic primary production, induce ‘reverse’ succession in riparian vegetation assemblages, and increase habitat complexity and biodiversity on reach scales. We then examine the key feedbacks and overlaps between these changes caused by beavers, where the decrease in longitudinal hydrologic connectivity create ponds and wetlands, transitions between lentic to lotic ecosystems, increase vertical hydraulic exchange gradients, and biogeochemical cycling per unit stream length, while increased lateral connectivity will determine the extent of open water area and wetland and littoral zone habitats, and induce changes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem assemblages. However, the extent of these impacts depends firstly on the hydro-geomorphic landscape context, which determines the extent of floodplain inundation, a key driver of subsequent changes to hydrologic, geomorphic, biogeochemical, and ecosystem dynamics. Secondly, it depends on the length of time beavers can sustain disturbance at a given site, which is constrained by top down (e.g. predation) and bottom up (e.g. competition) feedbacks, and ultimately determines the pathways of river corridor landscape and ecosystem succession following beaver abandonment.

"Dam builders and their works; beaver influences on the structure and function of river corridor hydrology, geomorphology, biogeochemistry and ecosystems","Beavers (Castor fiber, Castor canadensis) are one of the most influential mammalian ecosystem engineers, heavily modifying river corridor hydrology, geomorphology, nutrient cycling, and ecosystems. As an agent of disturbance, they achieve this first and foremost through dam construction, which impounds flow and increases the extent of open water, and from which all other landscape and ecosystem impacts follow. After a long period of local and regional eradication, beaver populations have been recovering and expanding throughout Europe and North America, as well as an introduced species in South America, prompting a need to comprehensively review the current state of knowledge on how beavers influence the structure and function of river corridors. Here, we synthesize the overall impacts on hydrology, geomorphology, biogeochemistry, and aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Our key findings are that a complex of beaver dams can increase surface and subsurface water storage, modify the reach scale partitioning of water budgets, allow site specific flood attenuation, alter low flow hydrology, increase evaporation, increase water and nutrient residence times, increase geomorphic heterogeneity, delay sediment transport, increase carbon, nutrient and sediment storage, expand the extent of anaerobic conditions and interfaces, increase the downstream export of dissolved organic carbon and ammonium, decrease the downstream export of nitrate, increase lotic to lentic habitat transitions and aquatic primary production, induce 'reverse' succession in riparian vegetation assemblages, and increase habitat complexity and biodiversity on reach scales. We then examine the key feedbacks and overlaps between these changes caused by beavers, where the decrease in longitudinal hydrologic connectivity create ponds and wetlands, transitions between lentic to lotic ecosystems, increase vertical hydraulic exchange gradients, and biogeochemical cycling per unit stream length, while increased lateral connectivity will determine the extent of open water area and wetland and littoral zone habitats, and induce changes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem assemblages. However, the extent of these impacts depends firstly on the hydro-geomorphic landscape context, which determines the extent of floodplain inundation, a key driver of subsequent changes to hydrologic, geomorphic, biogeochemical, and ecosystem dynamics. Secondly, it depends on the length of time beavers can sustain disturbance at a given site, which is constrained by top down (e.g. predation) and bottom up (e.g. competition) feedbacks, and ultimately determines the pathways of river corridor landscape and ecosystem succession following beaver abandonment. This outsized influence of beavers on river corridor processes and feedbacks is also fundamentally distinct from what occurs in their absence. Current river management and restoration practices are therefore open to re-examination in order to account for the impacts of beavers, both positive and negative, such that they can potentially accommodate and enhance the ecosystem engineering services they provide. It is hoped that our synthesis and holistic framework for evaluating beaver impacts can be used in this endeavor by river scientists and managers into the future as beaver populations continue to expand in both numbers and range.",2552303537, 904565-4,Scholarly Journals," Wageningen University & Research, Department of Soil Geography and Landscape","Larsen, Annegret;Larsen, Joshua R;Lane, Stuart N", ESREBW,," GeoRef in Process, Copyright 2021, American Geosciences Institute.

Machine learning algorithm-based risk assessment of riparian wetlands in Padma River Basin of Northwest Bangladesh.,"Wetland risk assessment is a global concern especially in developing countries like Bangladesh. The present study explored the spatiotemporal dynamics of wetlands, prediction of wetland risk assessment. The wetland risk assessment was predicted based on ten selected parameters, such as fragmentation probability, distance to road, and settlement. We used M5P, random forest (RF), reduced error pruning tree (REPTree), and support vector machine (SVM) machine learning techniques for wetland risk assessment. The results showed that wetland areas at present are declining less than one-third of those in 1988 due to the construction of the dam at Farakka, which is situated at the upstream of the Padma River. The distance to the river and built-up area are the two most contributing drivers influencing the wetland risk assessment based on information gain ratio (InGR). The prediction results of machine learning models showed 64.48% of area by M5P, 61.75% of area by RF, 62.18% of area by REPTree, and 55.74% of area by SVM have been predicted as the high and very high-risk zones. The results of accuracy assessment showed that the RF outperformed than other models (area under curve: 0.83), followed by the SVM, M5P, and REPTree. Degradation of wetlands explored in this study demonstrated the negative effects on biodiversity. Therefore, to conserve and protect the wetlands, continuous monitoring of wetlands using high resolution satellite images, feeding with the ecological flow, confining built up area and agricultural expansion towards wetlands, and new wetland creation is essential for wetland management.",2495403946, 33651294,Scholarly Journals,,"Islam, Abu Reza Md Towfiqul;Talukdar, Swapan;Mahato, Susanta;Ziaul, Sk;Eibek, Kutub Uddin;Akhter, Shumona;Pham, Quoc Bao;Mohammadi, Babak;Karimi, Firoozeh;Linh, Nguyen Thi Thuy",,,," Islam, Abu Reza Md Towfiqul", 2021-07-14, 2021-03-02, 2021-07-14, 10.1007/s11356-021-12806-z, Journal Article, 1614-7499, 2021-03-02, July 2021,, National Library of Medicine,,26, English, English, MEDLINE, 34450-34471,,July 2021,Environmental science and pollution research international, CSAPTjournals,2021, Germany,,28,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/machine-learning-algorithm-based-risk-assessment/docview/2495403946/se-2?accountid=14505," Environmental science and pollution research international, July 2021, 28(26):34450-34471",,,,,,," Erratum In:<br/>

Temporal Coherence Between Lake and Landscape Primary Productivity,"Understanding the patterns and drivers of primary productivity is a major goal of ecology, but little is known about whether the primary productivities of different types of ecosystems—here, lakes and the landscapes in which they are embedded—fluctuate in related ways through time. Due to shared climatic variation and well-known connections between lake and terrestrial ecosystems, such as nutrient and resource subsidies, we hypothesized that interannual fluctuations in aquatic and terrestrial primary productivity indices could be coherent. We also expected that lake and watershed characteristics could modify the strength and nature of primary productivity relationships. We applied wavelet coherence analyses to time series of lake chlorophyll-a and satellite-derived NDVI to examine coherence between lakes and land, and used random forest regression and generalized additive models to evaluate why coherence varies among lakes. There can be substantial coherence between lake and terrestrial primary productivity, but the strength and phase (direction and time lag) of this relationship vary widely, and there were marked differences between short (2–4-year periods of oscillation) and long (&gt; 4-year periods of oscillation) timescales. Across all timescales, variables associated with the connectedness of lakes to their watersheds were consistently the important explanatory variables of the strength and phase of coherence. The patterns observed in this study suggest the importance of cross-ecosystem flows, as opposed to shared climatic variation, in determining temporal coherence between lakes and the landscape.",2517102093,,Scholarly Journals," University of Virginia, Department of Environmental Sciences, Charlottesville, USA (GRID:grid.27755.32) (ISNI:0000 0000 9136 933X) , Iowa State University, Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology, Ames, USA (GRID:grid.34421.30) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 7312) , University of Kansas, Kansas Applied Remote Sensing Program, Kansas Biological Survey, Lawrence, USA (GRID:grid.266515.3) (ISNI:0000 0001 2106 0692) , University of Virginia, Department of Environmental Sciences, Charlottesville, USA (GRID:grid.27755.32) (ISNI:0000 0000 9136 933X) , Iowa State University, Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology, Ames, USA (GRID:grid.34421.30) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 7312)","Walter, Jonathan A;Fleck, Rachel;Kastens, Jude H;Pace, Michael L;Wilkinson, Grace M",,," © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Seasonal variations in food web dynamics of floodplain lakes with contrasting hydrological connectivity in the Southern Gulf of Mexico,"Floodplains are some of the most productive and diverse ecosystems on Earth. The Usumacinta River Basin, in the Southern Gulf of Mexico, hosts several floodplain lakes, whose integrity is threatened by water resource development. We aimed to investigate how food webs in these ecosystems vary in relation to their hydrological connectivity and seasonal flood cycles. To do this, we combined analysis of water quality and stable isotopes in two lakes with permanent connection to the Usumacinta River and two isolated lakes during dry, early rainy and late rainy season. Significant differences in chlorophyll-a, nutrients and suspended solids were reflected in distinct trophic dynamics among lakes. Stable isotope analysis revealed that fish from all lakes relied predominantly on autochthonous primary production, but while phytoplankton was the dominant resource for fish in the isolated lakes, aquatic macrophytes made the highest contribution to consumers’ production in the connected lakes. Fish tended to have broader isotopic niches during the early rainy season, likely reflecting consumption of a wider range of resources following the first flow pulses of the year. Our study highlights the importance of hydrological connectivity and natural flow regimes to maintain the outstanding biodiversity and fishery yield of these floodplain ecosystems.",2574330225, IND607264791,Scholarly Journals," Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, CONACYT-El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico , Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, CONACYT-El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico , Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, CONACYT-El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico , Departamento de Ciencias de la Sustentabilidad, El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico , Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico. rrodiles@ecosur.mx , Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, CONACYT-El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico , Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, CONACYT-El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico","Cazzanelli, Matteo;Soria-Barreto, Miriam;Castillo, María Mercedes;Rodiles-Hernández, Rocío",,,," Cazzanelli, Matteo , Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, CONACYT-El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico , Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, CONACYT-El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico",,,, 10.1007/s10750-020-04468-8, Journal Article,,, Feb 2021,,,0018-8158,4, English, English,, p. 773-797,,Feb 2021,Hydrobiologia, CSAPTjournals,2021, Springer International Publishing," National Agricultural Library, © Springer International Publishing",848,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/seasonal-variations-food-web-dynamics-floodplain/docview/2574330225/se-2?accountid=14505," Hydrobiologia, 2021 Feb., v. 848, no. 4, p. 773-797, Springer International Publishing, 0018-8158",,,,,,," Hydrobiologia. 2021 Feb., v. 848, no. 4 Springer International Publishing , NAL-AP-2-clean , Available from publisher's site", 773,,," biodiversity , chlorophyll , fish , fisheries , floodplains , food webs , macrophytes , phytoplankton , primary productivity , resource management , rivers , stable isotopes , water analysis , water quality , watersheds , wet season , Gulf of Mexico , Gulf of Mexico"," article , article",,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Seasonal+variations+in+food+web+dynamics+of+floodplain+lakes+with+contrasting+hydrological+connectivity+in+the+Southern+Gulf+of+Mexico&amp;author=Cazzanelli%2C+Matteo%3BSoria-Barreto%2C+Miriam%3BCastillo%2C+Mar%C3%ADa+Mercedes%3BRodiles-Hern%C3%A1ndez%2C+Roc%C3%ADo&amp;volume=848&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=773&amp;date=2021&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Hydrobiologia&amp;issn=0018-8158&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagricolamodule_IND607264791,Natural Science Collection

Effects and prediction of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of aquatic food webs,"Nonpoint source pollution entering rivers will pollute water quality, degrading the health of aquatic ecosystems. However, owing to the lack of quantitative research on the effects of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of aquatic food webs, there is a lack of quantitative basis for river management. Nonpoint source pollution is not only difficult to control effectively, but also the success rate of water ecological restoration projects is low. With the increasing proportion of nonpoint source pollution in water environmental problems, it is urgent to quantitatively assess and predict the impact of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of food webs. Therefore, this thesis presents a method for quantitatively assessing and predicting the impact of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of food webs through using fuzzy clustering to screen the typical points of the impact of nonpoint source pollution, then using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and partial least squares regression analysis to comprehensively filtrate the driving factors affect food web that results in nonpoint source pollution, and then determining the impact of each driving factor on the structure of food webs. Finally, the change trend of food web structure is predicted. The results show that (1) the driving factors that the nonpoint source pollution that affects the food web structure is NH 3 ‐N and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The increase in NH 3 ‐N and COD promotes the growth of phytoplankton, causing the change of the primary productivity of the ecosystem, and ultimately changes the entire food web structure; (2) NH 3 ‐N and COD affect the stability, maturity, connectivity and complexity of the aquatic food web structure. The increase of NH 3 ‐N increases the connectivity and maturity of the food web structure but reduces complexity and stability; the increase of COD increases the connection of the food web structure, while reducing the other three indicators; (3) in some areas with good water quality, aquatic species diversity is high, the relationship of interspecies dietary is complex, food web structure level index is high and the structure of food web is stable. The food web structure in the rainy season will be better than that in the dry season. In some areas with severe water pollution and poor food web structure, the ability of the food web to resist external interference is weak. The food web structure in the rainy season will be worse than that in the dry season owing to rainfall into the river. The methods and conclusions in this treatise can provide a reliable and quantitative scientific basis for river ecosystem management and ecosystem restoration and can improve the success rate of ecological restoration projects.",2478074154,,Scholarly Journals," College of Water Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Hydrological Cycle and Sponge City Technology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China; ICube, UdS, CNRS (UMR 7357), Illkirch, France , College of Water Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Hydrological Cycle and Sponge City Technology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China , College of Water Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Hydrological Cycle and Sponge City Technology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China , Jinan Survey Bureau of Hydrology and Water Resources, Jinan, China , Jinan Survey Bureau of Hydrology and Water Resources, Jinan, China , Jinan Survey Bureau of Hydrology and Water Resources, Jinan, China , Jinan Survey Bureau of Hydrology and Water Resources, Jinan, China , State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau, Institute of Soil and Water Conservation, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China; School of Life Sciences, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","Zhao, Chang S;Pan, Xu;Yang, Sheng T;Xiang, Hua;Zhao, Jin;Gan, Xin J;Ding, Su Y;Yu, Qiang",,," © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,,, 10.1002/eco.2257, Journal Article,, 2020-11-04, Jan 2021,,,1936-0584,1, English, English,,, Oxford,Jan 2021,Ecohydrology,,2021,,,14,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/effects-prediction-nonpoint-source-pollution-on/docview/2478074154/se-2?accountid=14505,,,,,,,," 2020-07-02 (Received) , 2020-08-16 (Revised) , 2020-09-16 (Accepted)",,,," Chemical oxygen demand , Ecosystem management , Food webs , Phytoplankton , Ammonia , Rivers , Species diversity , Regression analysis , Rivers , Dry season , Nonpoint source pollution , Phytoplankton , Chemical oxygen demand , Nonpoint source pollution , Nonpoint source pollution , Water quality , Nonpoint source pollution , Restoration , Species diversity , Clustering , Stability , Phytoplankton , Ecosystem management , Primary production , Rainy season , Pollution effects , Regression analysis , Chemical oxygen demand , Ammonia , Environmental restoration , Regression analysis , Diet , Rainfall , Water pollution , Chemical oxygen demand , Restoration , Species diversity , Aquatic ecosystems , Rivers , Environmental changes , Environmental restoration , Water quality , Rainfall , Rainy season , Ecological effects , Water pollution , Water pollution , Quantitative analysis , Food webs , Ecosystem management , Water quality , Food chains , Filtrate , Aquatic ecosystems , Food sources , Phytoplankton , Water quality , Rainfall , Food webs , Ammonia , River ecology , Pollution sources , Dry season , Dry season , Ammonia , Food chains , Complexity , Rainy season , Impact prediction , Rainfall , Water quality , Water pollution"," aquatic ecosystem , aquatic food webs , Jinan City , nonpoint source pollution",,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Effects+and+prediction+of+nonpoint+source+pollution+on+the+structure+of+aquatic+food+webs&amp;author=Zhao%2C+Chang+S%3BPan%2C+Xu%3BYang%2C+Sheng+T%3BXiang%2C+Hua%3BZhao%2C+Jin%3BGan%2C+Xin+J%3BDing%2C+Su+Y%3BYu%2C+Qiang&amp;volume=14&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=&amp;date=2021&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Ecohydrology&amp;issn=1936-0584&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aaqualine_,Natural Science Collection
"A Meta-Analysis of Environmental Tradeoffs of Hydropower Dams in the Sekong, Sesan, and Srepok (3S) Rivers of the Lower Mekong Basin","In Mekong riparian countries, hydropower development provides energy, but also threatens biodiversity, ecosystems, food security, and an unparalleled freshwater fishery. The Sekong, Sesan, and Srepok Rivers (3S Basin) are major tributaries to the Lower Mekong River (LMB), making up 10% of the Mekong watershed but supporting nearly 40% of the fish species of the LMB. Forty-five dams have been built, are under construction, or are planned in the 3S Basin. We completed a meta-analysis of aquatic and riparian environmental losses from current, planned, and proposed hydropower dams in the 3S and LMB using 46 papers and reports from the past three decades. Proposed mainstem Stung Treng and Sambor dams were not included in our analysis because Cambodia recently announced a moratorium on mainstem Mekong River dams. More than 50% of studies evaluated hydrologic change from dam development, 33% quantified sediment alteration, and 30% estimated fish production changes. Freshwater fish diversity, non-fish species, primary production, trophic ecology, and nutrient loading objectives were less commonly studied. We visualized human and environmental tradeoffs of 3S dams from the reviewed papers. Overall, Lower Sesan 2, the proposed Sekong Dam, and planned Lower Srepok 3A and Lower Sesan 3 have considerable environmental impacts. Tradeoff analyses should include environmental objectives by representing organisms, habitats, and ecosystems to quantify environmental costs of dam development and maintain the biodiversity and extraordinary freshwater fishery of the LMB.",2474777248,,Scholarly Journals,,,,," © 2021.

Intra-Annual Patterns in the Benthic-Pelagic Fluxes of Dissolved and Particulate Matter,"In coastal temperate environments, many processes known to affect the exchange of particulate and dissolved matter between the seafloor and the water column follow cyclical patterns of intra-annual variation. This study assesses the extent to which these individual short term temporal variations affect specific direct drivers of seafloor-water exchanges, how they interact with one another throughout the year, and what the resulting seasonal variation in the direction and magnitude of benthic-pelagic exchange. Existing data from a multidisciplinary long-term time-series from the Western Channel Observatory, UK, were combined with new experimental and in-situ data collected throughout a full seasonal cycle. These data were used to define an average year, split into five ‘periods’ (winter, pre-bloom, bloom, post-bloom and autumn) based around the known importance of pelagic primary production and hydrodynamically active phases of the year. Multivariate analyses were used to identify specific sub-sets of parameters that described the various direct drivers of seafloor-water exchanges. Both dissolved and particulate exchange showed three distinct periods of significant flux during the year, although the specific timings of these periods and the cause-effect relationships to the direct and indirect drivers differed between the two types of flux. Dissolved matter exchange was dominated by an upward flux in the pre-bloom period driven by diffusion, then a biologically induced upward flux during the bloom and an autumn downward flux. The latter was attributable to the interactions of hydrodynamic and biological activity on the seafloor. Particulate matter exchanges exhibited a strongly hydrologically influenced upward flux during the winter, followed by a biologically induced downward flux during the bloom and a second period of downward flux throughout post-bloom and autumn periods. This was driven primarily through interactions between biological activity, and physical and meteorological drivers. The integrated, holistic and quantitative data-based analysis of intra-annual variability in benthic/pelagic fluxes presented in this study in a representative temperate coastal environment, demonstrates not only the various process’ inter-connectivity, but also their relative importance to each other. Future investigations or modelling efforts of similar systems will benefit greatly from the relationships and baseline rules established in this study.",2464482260,,Scholarly Journals,,"Rühl, Saskia;Thompson, Charlie E L;Queirós, Ana M;Widdicombe, Stephen",,," © 2020.

Trophic structure of apex fish communities in closed versus leaky lakes of arctic Alaska,"Despite low species diversity and primary production, trophic structure (e.g., top predator species, predator size) is surprisingly variable among Arctic lakes. We investigated trophic structure in lakes of arctic Alaska containing arctic char Salvelinus alpinus using stomach contents and stable isotope ratios in two geographically-close but hydrologically-distinct lake clusters to investigate how these fish may interact and compete for limited food resources. Aside from different lake connectivity patterns (‘leaky’ versus ‘closed’), differing fish communities (up to five versus only two species) between lake clusters allowed us to test trophic hypotheses including: (1) arctic char are more piscivorous, and thereby grow larger and obtain higher trophic positions, in the presence of other fish species; and, (2) between arctic char size classes, resource polymorphism is more prominent, and thereby trophic niches are narrower and overlap less, in the absence of other predators. Regardless of lake cluster, we observed little direct evidence of arctic char consuming other fishes, but char were larger (mean TL = 468 vs 264 mm) and trophic position was higher (mean TP = 4.0 vs 3.8 for large char) in lakes with other fishes. Further, char demonstrated less intraspecific overlap when other predators were present whereas niche overlap was up to 100% in closed, char only lakes. As hydrologic characteristics (e.g., lake connectivity, water temperatures) will change across the Arctic owing to climate change, our results provide insight regarding potential concomitant changes to fish interactions and increase our understanding of lake trophic structure to guide management and conservation goals.",2551966841, IND607166152,Scholarly Journals," Department of Watershed Sciences, The Ecology Center, Utah State University, 5210 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT, 84322-5210, USA. stephen.klobucar@gmail.com , Department of Watershed Sciences, The Ecology Center, Utah State University, 5210 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT, 84322-5210, USA , Department of Watershed Sciences, The Ecology Center, Utah State University, 5210 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT, 84322-5210, USA , Department of Watershed Sciences, The Ecology Center, Utah State University, 5210 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT, 84322-5210, USA. stephen.klobucar@gmail.com , Department of Watershed Sciences, The Ecology Center, Utah State University, 5210 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT, 84322-5210, USA","Klobucar, Stephen L;Budy, Phaedra",,,," Klobucar, Stephen L , Department of Watershed Sciences, The Ecology Center, Utah State University, 5210 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT, 84322-5210, USA. stephen.klobucar@gmail.com , Department of Watershed Sciences, The Ecology Center, Utah State University, 5210 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT, 84322-5210, USA",,,, 10.1007/s00442-020-04776-9, Journal Article,,, Nov 2020,,,0029-8549,3, English, English,, p. 491-504,,Nov 2020,Oecologia, CSAPTjournals,2020, Springer Berlin Heidelberg," National Agricultural Library, © Springer Berlin Heidelberg",194,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/trophic-structure-apex-fish-communities-closed/docview/2551966841/se-2?accountid=14505," Oecologia, 2020 Nov., v. 194, no. 3, p. 491-504, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 0029-8549",,,,,,," Oecologia. 2020 Nov., v. 194, no. 3 Springer Berlin Heidelberg , NAL-AP-2-clean , Available from publisher's site", 491,,," Salvelinus alpinus , climate change , fish , hydrology , lakes , piscivores , primary productivity , species diversity , stable isotopes , stomach , Alaska , Arctic region , Alaska , Arctic region"," article , article",,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Trophic+structure+of+apex+fish+communities+in+closed+versus+leaky+lakes+of+arctic+Alaska&amp;author=Klobucar%2C+Stephen+L%3BBudy%2C+Phaedra&amp;volume=194&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=491&amp;date=2020&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Oecologia&amp;issn=0029-8549&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagricolamodule_IND607166152,Natural Science Collection

Effect of Hydrological Connectivity on the Phosphorus Buffering Capacity of an Urban Floodplain,"Floodplains can perform nutrient buffering functions and therefore influence the riverine nutrient dynamics depending on the extent of the hydrological connectivity. This work focused on quantifying the adsorption/desorption potential of a degraded floodplain of the Danube River (Lower Lobau) based on sediment characterization (grain size distribution, organic content, and P-fractions) and sediment type-specific P-adsorption via batch experiments. We established an adsorption/desorption budget model with a high temporal and spatial resolution. With this model, we identified spatial patterns related to hydrology and calculated the phosphorus buffering capacity of permanent and temporary floodplain water bodies. Sediment characteristics were defined by the distance to the inflow area and the hydrological connectivity of the floodplain water bodies. The main factor for the concentration of total phosphorus (Ptot) in the sediments was the grain size distribution. Ptot was ten times higher in silt-dominated sediments compared to gravel-dominated sediments. Inorganic phosphorus (Pinorg) ranged between 36 and 90% depending on the organic content of the sediments. Both the adsorption and the desorption potential of SRP (soluble reactive phosphorus) were highest in large, frequently connected water bodies and were strongly controlled by hydrology. The total adsorption potential of the floodplain was up to 40 times higher in wet years (e.g., 2002) than in dry years (e.g., 2003), when floodplain water bodies were connected less frequently to the main channel of the Danube. Up to 75% of the adsorbed SRP was desorbed and released into the water column after periods of connection. Consequently, SRP adsorption directly reduced the P-load in the Danube River main channel. The adsorption/desorption mechanisms worked as a buffering system by taking up the SRP imported during floods and releasing it over a longer period after the floods. This stimulated high primary production in the floodplain water bodies and impacted the overall P-retention of the floodplain.",2435334395,,Scholarly Journals,,"Preiner, Stefan;Bondar-Kunze, Elisabeth;Pitzl, Beate;Weigelhofer, Gabriele;Hein, Thomas",,," © 2020.

Resilience to drought of dryland wetlands threatened by climate change.,"Dryland wetlands are resilient ecosystems that can adapt to extreme periodic drought-flood episodes. Climate change projections show increased drought severity in drylands that could compromise wetland resilience and reduce important habitat services. These recognized risks have been difficult to evaluate due to our limited capacity to establish comprehensive relationships between flood-drought episodes and vegetation responses at the relevant spatiotemporal scales. We address this issue by integrating detailed spatiotemporal flood-drought simulations with remotely sensed vegetation responses to water regimes in a dryland wetland known for its highly variable inundation. We show that a combination of drought tolerance and dormancy strategies allow wetland vegetation to recover after droughts and recolonize areas invaded by terrestrial species. However, climate change scenarios show widespread degradation during drought and limited recovery after floods.

Woody Plant Encroachment has a Larger Impact than Climate Change on Dryland Water Budgets.,"Woody plant encroachment (WPE) into grasslands is a global phenomenon that is associated with land degradation via xerification, which replaces grasses with shrubs and bare soil patches. It remains uncertain how the global processes of WPE and climate change may combine to impact water availability for ecosystems. Using a process-based model constrained by watershed observations, our results suggest that both xerification and climate change augment groundwater recharge by increasing channel transmission losses at the expense of plant available water. Conversion from grasslands to shrublands without creating additional bare soil, however, reduces transmission losses. Model simulations considering both WPE and climate change are used to assess their relative roles in a late 21st century condition. Results indicate that changes in focused channel recharge are determined primarily by the WPE pathway. As a result, WPE should be given consideration when assessing the vulnerability of groundwater aquifers to climate change.",2404048751, 32415221,Scholarly Journals,,"Schreiner-McGraw, Adam P;Vivoni, Enrique R;Ajami, Hoori;Sala, Osvaldo E;Throop, Heather L;Peters, Debra P C",,,," Schreiner-McGraw, Adam P", 2020-10-02, 2020-05-17, 2021-05-15, 10.1038/s41598-020-65094-x," Research Support, Non-u.s.

"Suspended sediment, nutrients, and chlorophyll in tropical floodplain lakes with different patterns of hydrological connectivity","The ecological functioning of floodplain lakes is largely influenced by the interaction with the river mainstem. In this study, seasonal variation in water chemistry and the relationship with the river conditions were compared between floodplain lakes that differ in the level of connection to the Usumacinta River, the largest river of Mesoamerica. Samples for suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll a were collected through the year in lakes permanently connected to the river and in lakes that only received water from the Usumacinta for a short period during peak flow. Floodplain lakes showed higher total suspended solids than the river during the dry season while during the rainy season greater differences were observed between the river and the lakes, probably explained by higher concentrations in the river and greater sedimentation in the lakes. Greater organic matter content in the suspended solids was observed in the floodplain lakes, particularly in the more isolated lakes, likely related to high algal biomass. Nitrate concentrations were always higher in the river than in the lakes and lower nitrate concentrations occurred at the isolated lakes, suggesting that processes that remove nitrate occur through the year and are a common feature of floodplain lakes. Phosphorus in the connected lakes was higher than in the river only during the dry season, while in the isolated lakes concentrations were always greater than in the river. Chlorophyll a concentrations were higher in the connected lakes than in the river only during the dry season, while the more isolated lakes exhibited higher values through the year, showing signs of eutrophication. Suspended organic matter, nitrate, and chlorophyll showed larger differences between lake and river sites in the more isolated lakes, probably related to greater water residence time and its influence on primary production. Less connected lakes are more vulnerable to flow alteration because the brief period of connection to the river can be compromised and the effects of eutrophication exacerbated.",2439434677, IND606935911,Scholarly Journals," Departamento de Ciencias de la Sustentabilidad, El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico , Departamento de Ciencias de la Sustentabilidad, El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico","Castillo, María M",,,," Castillo, María M , Departamento de Ciencias de la Sustentabilidad, El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico",,,, 10.1016/j.limno.2020.125767, Journal Article,,, May 2020,,,0075-9511,, English, English,,,,May 2020,Limnologica, CSAPTjournals,2020, Elsevier GmbH," National Agricultural Library, © Elsevier GmbH",82,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/suspended-sediment-nutrients-chlorophyll-tropical/docview/2439434677/se-2?accountid=14505," Limnologica, 2020 May, v. 82, Elsevier GmbH, 0075-9511",,,,,,," Limnologica. 2020 May, v. 82 Elsevier GmbH , Available from publisher's site",,,," algae , biomass , chlorophyll , dry season , ecological function , eutrophication , floodplains , hydrochemistry , lakes , nitrates , nutrients , organic matter , phosphorus , primary productivity , rivers , seasonal variation , suspended sediment , total suspended solids , wet season , Central America , Central America"," article , Floodplain , Tropics , Seasonality , Connectivity , article",,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Suspended+sediment%2C+nutrients%2C+and+chlorophyll+in+tropical+floodplain+lakes+with+different+patterns+of+hydrological+connectivity&amp;author=Castillo%2C+Mar%C3%ADa+M&amp;volume=82&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2020&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Limnologica&amp;issn=0075-9511&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagricolamodule_IND606935911,Natural Science Collection
Drought alters the biogeochemistry of boreal stream networks.,"Drought is a global phenomenon, with widespread implications for freshwater ecosystems. While droughts receive much attention at lower latitudes, their effects on northern river networks remain unstudied. We combine a reach-scale manipulation experiment, observations during the extreme 2018 drought, and historical monitoring data to examine the impact of drought in northern boreal streams. Increased water residence time during drought promoted reductions in aerobic metabolism and increased concentrations of reduced solutes in both stream and hyporheic water. Likewise, data during the 2018 drought revealed widespread hypoxic conditions and shifts towards anaerobic metabolism, especially in headwaters. Finally, long-term data confirmed that past summer droughts have led to similar metabolic alterations. Our results highlight the potential for drought to promote biogeochemical shifts that trigger poor water quality conditions in boreal streams. Given projected increases in hydrological extremes at northern latitudes, the consequences of drought for the health of running waters warrant attention.",2389689161, 32286262,Scholarly Journals,,"Gómez-Gener, Lluís;Lupon, Anna;Laudon, Hjalmar;Sponseller, Ryan A",,,," Gómez-Gener, Lluís", 2020-07-14, 2020-04-15, 2021-04-14, 10.1038/s41467-020-15496-2," Research Support, Non-u.s.

Soil bacterial diversity mediated by microscale aqueous-phase processes across biomes,"Soil bacterial diversity varies across biomes with potential impacts on soil ecological functioning. Here, we incorporate key factors that affect soil bacterial abundance and diversity across spatial scales into a mechanistic modeling framework considering soil type, carbon inputs and climate towards predicting soil bacterial diversity. The soil aqueous-phase content and connectivity exert strong influence on bacterial diversity for each soil type and rainfall pattern. Biome-specific carbon inputs deduced from net primary productivity provide constraints on soil bacterial abundance independent from diversity. The proposed heuristic model captures observed global trends of bacterial diversity in good agreement with predictions by an individual-based mechanistic model. Bacterial diversity is highest at intermediate water contents where the aqueous phase forms numerous disconnected habitats and soil carrying capacity determines level of occupancy. The framework delineates global soil bacterial diversity hotspots; located mainly in climatic transition zones that are sensitive to potential climate and land use changes. Numerous micro- and macro-scale factors influence soil microbial diversity. Here the authors create a model to demonstrate that fine scale soil moisture influences the carrying capacity of microbes, which then scales up to larger biogeographic patterns.",2342970499,,Scholarly Journals," ETH Zürich, Soil and Terrestrial Environmental Physics (STEP), Department of Environmental Systems Sciences (USYS), Zürich, Switzerland (GRID:grid.5801.c) (ISNI:0000 0001 2156 2780)  , ETH Zürich, Soil and Terrestrial Environmental Physics (STEP), Department of Environmental Systems Sciences (USYS), Zürich, Switzerland (GRID:grid.5801.c) (ISNI:0000 0001 2156 2780) ; Desert Research Institute, Division of Hydrologic Sciences, Reno, USA (GRID:grid.474431.1) (ISNI:0000 0004 0525 4843) ","Bickel, Samuel;Or Dani",,," This work is published under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ (the “License”).

"Linkages between flow regime, biota, and ecosystem processes: Implications for river restoration","River restoration guided by research Human activities have altered the flow regimes of many of Earth's rivers, with negative impacts on biodiversity, water quality, and ecological processes. In a Review, Palmer and Ruhi explain how restoration designs now attempt to mimic ecologically important aspects of natural flow regimes, guided by insights into how variations in flow affect biota and ecosystem processes. To be successful, such efforts must go beyond accounting for flood pulses to restore natural flow variability and achieve hydrological connectivity between a river and its surroundings. Science , this issue p. eaaw2087 BACKGROUND Early civilizations developed around seasonal river floodplains, and the natural rhythm of rivers remains critical to humans today. We use streams and rivers to meet drinking water, irrigation, and hydropower needs by storing and moving water in complex ways, at the times and places of our choosing. Consequently, many of Earth’s rivers have flow regimes that are “unnatural” in magnitude, frequency, duration, and timing. The rise in river degradation globally has motivated research on the link between hydrologic alteration and declines in valued biota. At the same time, largely fueled by new technologies and methods, research has expanded to understand the patterns in, and drivers of, riverine processes like primary production, in both near-pristine and degraded rivers. A third line of research, stymied by how difficult it has been to restore degraded rivers, has called for process-based restoration, building on knowledge from the other two research thrusts. Today’s hydroecological science seeks to understand the mechanisms whereby flow regimes affect biota and ecosystem processes, and the interplay between them, in a three-way interaction we call the flow-biota-ecosystem processes nexus. ADVANCES By shifting the focus from static patterns at sites to dynamic processes along river networks, advances are being made to understand the interactions and feedbacks at the nexus. Fueled by increasingly available time-series data and novel modeling, emerging research ranges from studies on regime-based properties such as flow periodicity and its change, to studies on river network structure and associated spatial variation in flow and water chemistry. These studies demonstrate how flow variability influences long-term persistence of riverine assemblages, and they are disentangling the direct effects of flow on communities and ecosystem processes from its indirect effects (e.g., via species interactions, light-blocking turbidity). Changes in temporal patterns in flow magnitudes can increase risk of community collapse and alter key ecosystem processes such as primary production. Growing research shows that storm flows not only enhance inputs and downstream export of terrestrially derived carbon to rivers but, when associated with sustained hydrologic connectivity with soils, exert particular influence on water chemistry and biogeochemical processes that can influence food webs. Increased availability of environmental sensors has stimulated research, showing that extreme flows may impart disproportionate impacts on stream metabolism, but the relationship can depend on the predictability of those flows. Research combining changes in flow patterns with stable isotope analyses is revealing how temporal fluctuations in habitat, and in the quality and quantity of basal resources, influence trophic pathways and resulting food-web structure. Evidence suggests that restoring particular facets of a flow regime can produce desirable conservation outcomes, but context is paramount. Restoration actions going beyond discrete flow events and enhancing groundwater-influenced river habitat or redirecting subsurface flow paths may be critical in future climates. OUTLOOK Our understanding of the flow-biota-ecosystem processes nexus is still incomplete and is a frontier research topic. Challenges include connecting organismal and ecosystem-level processes, and understanding the role of microbial communities as intermediaries. Capturing the effects of watershed-level physical and biogeochemical heterogeneity, and parsing out direct, indirect, or cascading effects of flow alteration on biota and processes would also reduce uncertainty in restoration outcomes, particularly in novel, nonstationary environments. Understanding how much flow restoration alone can achieve in urban watersheds is an urgent need, as is translating findings from hydroecology to design green infrastructure and flow release programs from reservoirs. These management tools may offer growing opportunities to experiment with flow regimes, which will assist in refining process-based river restoration. Both solid science, and effective translation into practice will be needed to curb the fast pace of global river ecosystem degradation. River ecosystems are highly biodiverse, influence global biogeochemical cycles, and provide valued services. However, humans are increasingly degrading fluvial ecosystems by altering their streamflows. Effective river restoration requires advancing our mechanistic understanding of how flow regimes affect biota and ecosystem processes. Here, we review emerging advances in hydroecology relevant to this goal. Spatiotemporal variation in flow exerts direct and indirect control on the composition, structure, and dynamics of communities at local to regional scales. Streamflows also influence ecosystem processes, such as nutrient uptake and transformation, organic matter processing, and ecosystem metabolism. We are deepening our understanding of how biological processes, not just static patterns, affect and are affected by stream ecosystem processes. However, research on this nexus of flow-biota-ecosystem processes is at an early stage. We illustrate this frontier with evidence from highly altered regulated rivers and urban streams. We also identify research challenges that should be prioritized to advance process-based river restoration.",2296393153,,Scholarly Journals,,,,," Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

"Collapse and failure of ancient agricultural stone terraces: On-site geomorphic processes, pedogenic mechanisms, and soil quality","Water is the major limiting factor for primary productivity in drylands. In ancient times, stone terraces aimed at runoff harvesting and soil erosion control were established, allowing agricultural crop production. Land abandonment and cease of maintenance have led to the collapse and failure of terraces in the hinterlands of the Roman/Byzantine city of Avdat in the arid Negev Desert, Israel. The objective of this study was to assess the geomorphic processes and pedogenic mechanisms related to terrace collapse, and their on-site impact on soil quality. We studied key properties of the top 10 cm of soil in intact-terrace plots and partially-collapsed terrace plots, as well as in ‘natural’ lands. Unexpectedly, the soil texture was finer in the partially collapsed-terrace plots (clay loam) than that in the intact-terrace plots (loam). This was attributed to transportation of mineral material by rolling, which sorts out the large primary particles. This process, which characterizes rill erosion of high erosive power, is probably the predominant surface process in this study. The soil penetration resistance was significantly greater in the partially-collapsed terrace plots, and was attributed to the continuous removal of recently deposited loose sediments and exposure of the underlying, compacted older sediments. Soil stoniness, which was 16-fold greater in the partially-collapsed terrace plots, was also attributed to soil erosion. Unexpectedly, the total organic carbon was similar in both terrace states. Yet, labile organic carbon was 41% lower in soil of the partially-collapsed terrace plots, suggesting greater susceptibility of this fraction to erosional processes. The low electrical conductivity in the soil of the intact-terrace plots, was attributed to the better leaching of salts. The soil's calculated available water capacity was 42% greater in the intact-terrace plots. The study suggests that these processes and mechanisms strengthen each other through a chain of feedbacks, resulting in accelerated degradation of the collapsed-terrace lands.",2237530685, IND606334745,Scholarly Journals," Dead Sea and Arava Science Center, Yotvata 88820, Israel , Dead Sea and Arava Science Center, Yotvata 88820, Israel , Politehnica University of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania , Dead Sea and Arava Science Center, Yotvata 88820, Israel","Stavi, Ilan;Gusarov, Yulia;Halbac-Cotoara-Zamfir, Rares",,,," Stavi, Ilan , Dead Sea and Arava Science Center, Yotvata 88820, Israel",,,, 10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.03.007, Journal Article,,," Jun 15, 2019",,,0016-7061,, English, English,, p. 144-152,,"Jun 15, 2019",Geoderma, CSAPTjournals,2019, Elsevier B.V.," National Agricultural Library, © Elsevier B.V.",344,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/collapse-failure-ancient-agricultural-stone/docview/2237530685/se-2?accountid=14505," Geoderma, 2019 June 15, v. 344, p. 144-152, Elsevier B.V., 0016-7061",,,,,,," Geoderma. 2019 June 15, v. 344 Elsevier B.V. , Available from publisher's site", 144,,," abandoned land , arid lands , available water capacity , clay loam soils , crop production , crops , electrical conductivity , erosion control , hinterland , labile carbon , leaching , primary productivity , rill erosion , salts , sediments , soil penetration resistance , soil quality , soil texture , terraces , total organic carbon , water harvesting , Israel , Israel"," article , Hydrological connectivity , Geoarchaeology , Patch- vs. meso-scale geodiversity , Soil salinity , Vegetation cover , article",,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Collapse+and+failure+of+ancient+agricultural+stone+terraces%3A+On-site+geomorphic+processes%2C+pedogenic+mechanisms%2C+and+soil+quality&amp;author=Stavi%2C+Ilan%3BGusarov%2C+Yulia%3BHalbac-Cotoara-Zamfir%2C+Rares&amp;volume=344&amp;issue=&amp;spage=144&amp;date=2019&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Geoderma&amp;issn=0016-7061&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagricolamodule_IND606334745,Natural Science Collection

"Variations in dissolved greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) in the Congo River network overwhelmingly driven by fluvial-wetland connectivity","We carried out 10&#xa0;field expeditions between 2010 and 2015 in the lowland part of the Congo River network in the eastern part of the basin (Democratic Republic of the Congo), to describe the spatial variations in fluvial dissolved carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ), methane ( CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide ( N 2 O ) concentrations. We investigate the possible drivers of the spatial variations in dissolved CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O concentrations by analyzing covariations with several other biogeochemical variables, aquatic metabolic processes (primary production and respiration), catchment characteristics (land cover) and wetland spatial distributions. We test the hypothesis that spatial patterns of CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O are partly due to the connectivity with wetlands, in particular with a giant wetland of flooded forest in the core of the Congo basin, the “Cuvette Centrale Congolaise” (CCC). Two transects of 1650 km were carried out from the city of Kisangani to the city of Kinshasa, along the longest possible navigable section of the river and corresponding to 41 % of the total length of the main stem. Additionally, three time series of CH 4 and N 2 O were obtained at fixed points in the main stem of the middle Congo (2013–2018, biweekly sampling), in the main stem of the lower Kasaï (2015–2017, monthly sampling) and in the main stem of the middle Oubangui (2010–2012, biweekly sampling). The variations in dissolved N 2 O concentrations were modest, with values oscillating around the concentration corresponding to saturation with the atmosphere, with N 2 O saturation level (% N 2 O , where atmospheric equilibrium corresponds to 100 %) ranging between 0 % and 561 % (average 142 %). The relatively narrow range of % N 2 O variations was consistent with low NH 4 + ( 2.3 ± 1.3 µ mol L - 1 ) and NO 3 - ( 5.6 ± 5.1 µ mol L - 1 ) levels in these near pristine rivers and streams, with low agriculture pressure on the catchment (croplands correspond to 0.1 % of catchment land cover of sampled rivers), dominated by forests ( ∼ 70 % of land cover). The covariations in % N 2 O , NH 4 + , NO 3 - and dissolved oxygen saturation level (% O 2 ) indicate N 2 O removal by soil or sedimentary denitrification in low O 2 , high NH 4 + and low NO 3 - environments (typically small and organic matter rich streams) and N 2 O production by nitrification in high O 2 , low NH 4 + and high NO 3 - (typical of larger rivers that are poor in organic matter). Surface waters were very strongly oversaturated in CO 2 and CH 4 with respect to atmospheric equilibrium, with values of the partial pressure of CO 2 ( p CO 2 ) ranging between 1087 and 22 899 ppm (equilibrium ∼ 400 ppm) and dissolved CH 4 concentrations ranging between 22 and 71 428 nmol L - 1 (equilibrium ∼ 2 nmol L - 1 ). Spatial variations were overwhelmingly more important than seasonal variations for p CO 2 , CH 4 and % N 2 O as well as day–night variations for p CO 2 . The wide range of p CO 2 and CH 4 variations was consistent with the equally wide range of % O 2 (0.3 %–122.8 %) and of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (1.8–67.8 mg L - 1 ), indicative of generation of these two greenhouse gases from intense processing of organic matter either in “terra firme” soils, wetlands or in-stream. However, the emission rate of CO 2 to the atmosphere from riverine surface waters was on average about&#xa0;10 times higher than the flux of CO 2 produced by aquatic net heterotrophy (as evaluated from measurements of pelagic respiration and primary production). This indicates that the CO 2 emissions from the river network were sustained by lateral inputs of CO 2 (either from terra firme or from wetlands). The p CO 2 and CH 4 values decreased and % O 2 increased with increasing Strahler order, showing that stream size explains part of the spatial variability of these quantities. In addition, several lines of evidence indicate that lateral inputs of carbon from wetlands (flooded forest and aquatic macrophytes) were of paramount importance in sustaining high CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations in the Congo river network, as well as driving spatial variations: the rivers draining the CCC were characterized by significantly higher p CO 2 and CH 4 and significantly lower % O 2 and % N 2 O values than those not draining the CCC; p CO 2 and % O 2 values were correlated to the coverage of flooded forest on the catchment. The flux of greenhouse gases (GHGs) between rivers and the atmosphere averaged 2469 mmol m - 2 d - 1 for CO 2 (range 86 and 7110 mmol m - 2 d - 1 ), 12 553 µ mol m - 2 d - 1 for CH 4 (range 65 and 597 260 µ mol m - 2 d - 1 ) and 22 µ mol m - 2 d - 1 for N 2 O (range - 52 and 319 µ mol m - 2 d - 1 ). The estimate of integrated CO 2 emission from the Congo River network ( 251 ± 46 TgC (10 12 gC) yr - 1 ), corresponding to nearly half the CO 2 emissions from tropical oceans globally (565 TgC yr - 1 ) and was nearly 2&#xa0;times the CO 2 emissions from the tropical Atlantic Ocean (137 TgC yr - 1 ). Moreover, the integrated CO 2 emission from the Congo River network is more than 3&#xa0;times higher than the estimate of terrestrial net ecosystem exchange (NEE) on the whole catchment (77 TgC yr - 1 ). This shows that it is unlikely that the CO 2 emissions from the river network were sustained by the hydrological carbon export from terra firme soils (typically very small compared to terrestrial NEE) but most likely, to a large extent, they were sustained by wetlands (with a much higher hydrological connectivity with rivers and streams).",2301328534,,Scholarly Journals," Chemical Oceanography Unit, University of Liège, Liège, Belgium , Chemical Oceanography Unit, University of Liège, Liège, Belgium; present address: Direction Générale Opérationnelle Agriculture, Ressources Naturelles et Environnement, Service Publique de Wallonie, Jambes, Belgium , Chemical Oceanography Unit, University of Liège, Liège, Belgium; present address: University of Lausanne, Institute of Earth Surface Dynamics, Lausanne, Switzerland , Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium , Department of Geography, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA , Université de Kisangani, Centre de Surveillance de la Biodiversité, Kisangani, Democratic Republic of the Congo , Université de Kisangani, Centre de Surveillance de la Biodiversité, Kisangani, Democratic Republic of the Congo , Université de Kisangani, Centre de Surveillance de la Biodiversité, Kisangani, Democratic Republic of the Congo , Congo Atomic Energy Commission, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo , Chemical Oceanography Unit, University of Liège, Liège, Belgium , Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; present address: Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland , Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","Borges, Alberto V;Darchambeau, François;Lambert, Thibault;Morana, Cédric;Allen, George H;Tambwe, Ernest;Sembaito, Alfred Toengaho;Taylor Mambo;Wabakhangazi, José Nlandu;Descy, Jean-Pierre;Teodoru, Cristian R;Bouillon, Steven",,," © 2019.

Groundwater‐River Water Exchange Enhances Growing Season Evapotranspiration and Carbon Uptake in a Semiarid Riparian Ecosystem,"Semiarid ecosystems play a critical role in determining the interannual variability of the global terrestrial carbon sink. Water availability is a critical driver of productivity in semiarid ecosystems, which often alternate between carbon sink/source functioning during wet/dry years. In this study, we investigate how groundwater availability resulting from groundwater‐river water exchange influences net ecosystem exchange of CO 2 (NEE), evapotranspiration (ET), and the surface energy balance at two semiarid ecosystems along the Columbia River in central Washington, USA. We examined 1&#xa0;year of eddy covariance measurements from an upland sagebrush ecosystem primarily fed by rainfall without groundwater access and a riparian grassland ecosystem with groundwater access during the dry season due to lateral groundwater‐river water exchange. The two sites had distinct seasonal patterns of NEE and ET, driven by differences in water availability. While NEE at the upland sagebrush site was strongly constrained by water availability during the dry months, access to groundwater allowed the riparian site to maintain high NEE magnitude and ET during the same dry months. The riparian site had larger annual gross primary productivity than the upland site (612 vs. 424&#xa0;gC/m 2 ), which was offset by higher ecosystem respiration (558 vs. 363&#xa0;gC/m 2 ). Thus, the magnitude of the annual NEE at the upland site was larger than that at the riparian site (−62 vs. −54&#xa0;gC/m 2 ). Our results demonstrate that groundwater access determined by connectivity between groundwater and surface water can be a critical driver of carbon uptake and ET in semiarid ecosystems.",2181797202,,Scholarly Journals," Laboratory for Atmospheric Research, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA , Laboratory for Atmospheric Research, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA , Laboratory for Atmospheric Research, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA , Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA , Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA , Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA , Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA , Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA , Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA , Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA , Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA","Missik, Justine E C;Liu, Heping;Gao, Zhongming;Huang, Maoyi;Chen, Xingyuan;Arntzen, Evan;Mcfarland, Douglas P;Ren, Huiying;Titzler, P Scott;Thomle, Jonathan N;Goldman, Amy",,, ©2019.

Ideas and perspectives: Carbon leaks from flooded land: do we need to replumb the inland water active pipe?,"At the global scale, inland waters are a significant source of atmospheric carbon (C), particularly in the tropics. The active pipe concept predicts that C emissions from streams, lakes and rivers are largely fuelled by terrestrial ecosystems. The traditionally recognized C transfer mechanisms from terrestrial to aquatic systems are surface runoff and groundwater drainage. We present here a series of arguments that support the idea that land flooding is an additional significant process that fuels inland waters with C at the global scale. Whether the majority of CO 2 emitted by rivers comes from floodable land (approximately 10 % of the continents) or from well-drained land is a fundamental question that impacts our capacity to predict how these C fluxes might change in the future. Using classical concepts in ecology, we propose, as a necessary step forward, an update of the active pipe concept that differentiates floodable land from drained land. Contrarily to well-drained land, many wetlands (in particular riparian and littoral wetlands) combine strong hydrological connectivity with inland waters, high productivity assimilating CO 2 from the atmosphere, direct transfer of litter and exudation products to water and waterlogged soils, a generally dominant allocation of ecosystem respiration (ER) below the water surface and a slow gas-exchange rate at the water–air interface. These properties force plants to pump atmospheric C to wetland waters and, when hydrology is favourable, to inland waters as organic C and dissolved CO 2 . This wetland CO 2 pump may contribute disproportionately to CO 2 emissions from inland waters, particularly in the tropics where 80 % of the global CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere occur. In future studies, more care must be taken in the way that vertical and horizontal C fluxes are conceptualized along watersheds, and 2-D models that adequately account for the hydrological export of all C species are necessary. In flooded ecosystems, significant effort should be dedicated to quantifying the components of primary production and respiration by the submerged and emerged part of the ecosystem community and to using these metabolic rates in coupled hydrological–biogeochemical models. The construction of a global typology of wetlands that includes productivity, gas fluxes and hydrological connectivity with inland waters also appears necessary to adequately integrate continental C fluxes at the global scale.",2178491235,,Scholarly Journals," Biologie des Organismes et Ecosystèmes Aquatiques (BOREA), UMR 7208, Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, CNRS, SU, UCN, UR, IRD, 61 rue Buffon, 75231, Paris CEDEX 05, France; Programa de Biologia Marinha e Ambientes Costeiros, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Outeiro São João Batista s/n, 24020015, Niterói, RJ, Brazil , Université de Liège, Unité d'Océanographie Chimique, Institut de Physique (B5a), 4000 Liège, Belgium","Abril, Gwenaël;Borges, Alberto V",,," © 2019.

Continental-scale consequences of tree die-offs in North America: identifying where forest loss matters most,"Regional-scale tree die-off events driven by drought and warming and associated pests and pathogens have occurred recently on all forested continents and are projected to increase in frequency and extent with future warming. Within areas where tree mortality has occurred, ecological, hydrological and meteorological consequences are increasingly being documented. However, the potential for tree die-off to impact vegetation processes and related carbon dynamics in areas remote to where die-off occurs has rarely been systematically evaluated, particularly for multiple distinct regions within a given continent. Such remote impacts can occur when climate effects of local vegetation change are propagated by atmospheric circulation—the phenomena of ‘ecoclimate teleconnections’. We simulated tree die-off events in the 13 most densely forested US regions (selected from the 20 US National Ecological Observatory Network [NEON] domains) and found that tree die-off even for smaller regions has potential to affect climate and hence Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) in disparate regions (NEON domains), either positively or negatively. Some regions exhibited strong teleconnections to several others, and some regions were relatively sensitive to tree loss regardless of what other region the tree loss occurred in. For the US as a whole, loss of trees in the Pacific Southwest—an area undergoing rapid tree die-off—had the largest negative impact on remote US GPP whereas loss of trees in the Mid-Atlantic had the largest positive impact. This research lays a foundation for hypotheses that identify how the effects of tree die-off (or other types of tree loss such as deforestation) can ricochet across regions by revealing hot-spots of forcing and response. Such modes of connectivity have direct applicability for improving models of climate change impacts and for developing more informed and coordinated carbon accounting across regions.",2548968852,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, United States of America; Department of Biology, University of Washington, Seattle, United States of America; Author to whom any correspondence should be addressed , Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, United States of America , Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, United States of America; Seattle Public Utilities, 700 5th Ave, Seattle, WA, United States of America , School of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of Arizona, Tucson, United States of America , School of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of Arizona, Tucson, United States of America; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, United States of America , School of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of Arizona, Tucson, United States of America , Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, United States of America , Department of Forestry, Michigan State University, East Lansing, United States of America , Grupo GIGA, Escuela Ambiental.

"Analysis of Anthropogenic, Climatological, and Morphological Influences on Dissolved Organic Matter in Rocky Mountain Streams","In recent decades, the Rocky Mountains (RM) have undergone significant changes associated with anthropogenic activities and natural disturbances. These changes have the potential to alter primary productivity and biomass carbon storage. In particular, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in RM streams can affect heterotrophic processes, act as a source for the nutrient cycle, absorb sunlight radiation, alter metal transport, and can promote the production of carcinogenic byproducts during water treatment. Recent studies have focused on the relationship between bark beetle infestations and stream organic matter but have reached conflicting conclusions. Consequently, here we compile and process multiple datasets representing features of the RM for the period 1983–2012 with the purpose of assessing their relative influence on stream DOC concentrations using spatial statistical modeling. Features representing climate, land cover, forest disturbances, topography, soil types, and anthropogenic activities are included. We focus on DOC during base-flow conditions in RM streams because base-flow concentrations are more representative of the longer-term (annual to decadal) impacts and are less dependent on episodic, short-term storm and runoff/erosion events. To predict DOC throughout the network, we use a stream network model in a 56,550 km2 area to address the intrinsic connectivity and hydrologic directionality of the stream network. Natural forest disturbances are positively correlated with increased DOC concentrations; however, the effect of urbanization is far greater. Similarly, higher maximum temperatures, which can be exacerbated by climate change, are also associated with elevated DOC concentrations. Overall, DOC concentrations present an increasing trend over time in the RM region.",2315283266, IND606533230,Scholarly Journals," Department of Statistical Science, Baylor University, One Bear Place #97140, Waco, TX 76798, USA. mandy_hering@baylor.edu , Department of Statistical Science, Baylor University, One Bear Place #97140, Waco, TX 76798, USA. mandy_hering@baylor.edu , Department of Statistical Science, Baylor University, One Bear Place #97140, Waco, TX 76798, USA. mandy_hering@baylor.edu","Rodríguez-Jeangros, Nicolás;McCray, John E;Hering, Amanda S",,,," Department of Statistical Science, Baylor University, One Bear Place #97140, Waco, TX 76798, USA. mandy_hering@baylor.edu",,,, 10.3390/w10040534, Journal Article,,," Apr 23, 2018",,,2073-4441,4, English, English,,,,"Apr 23, 2018",Water, CSAPTjournals,2018, Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute," National Agricultural Library, © Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute",10,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/analysis-anthropogenic-climatological/docview/2315283266/se-2?accountid=14505," Water, 2018 Apr. 23, v. 10, no. 4, Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute, 2073-4441",,,,,,," Water. 2018 Apr. 23, v. 10, no. 4 Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute , Available from publisher's site",,,," anthropogenic activities , bark beetle infestations , base flow , biomass , byproducts , carbon sequestration , carcinogenicity , climate , climate change , data collection , dissolved organic carbon , forests , land cover , primary productivity , runoff , soil types , solar radiation , statistical models , storms , streams , temperature , topography , urbanization , water treatment , Rocky Mountain region , Rocky Mountain region"," article , article",,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Analysis+of+Anthropogenic%2C+Climatological%2C+and+Morphological+Influences+on+Dissolved+Organic+Matter+in+Rocky+Mountain+Streams&amp;author=Rodri%CC%81guez-Jeangros%2C+Nicola%CC%81s%3BMcCray%2C+John+E%3BHering%2C+Amanda+S&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=&amp;date=2018&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Water&amp;issn=2073-4441&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagricolamodule_IND606533230,Natural Science Collection
Biogeochemistry and biodiversity in a network of saline–alkaline lakes: Implications of ecohydrological connectivity in the Kenyan Rift Valley,"The volcanic and tectonic lakes of the eastern branch of the African Great Rift Valley are exposed to multiple stressors and characterised by different levels of hydrological connectivity. Past volcanic activity generated endorheic basins, in which the nature of the bedrock, its connection with groundwater, and local climatic conditions, favoured the formation of highly alkaline soda waters. While little is known about their nutrient dynamics, most lakes in this area experience considerable microbial blooms and harbour diverse and specifically adapted microbial populations, some of which could embody novel biotechnological potential.Here we review the geochemical and (micro)biological features of a cluster of lakes distributed within the East African Rift, ranging from fresh to hypersaline, under different levels of hydrological connectivity. Possibly no other location on Earth has a comparable range of lake types in close proximity to each other and representing such a remarkable microbial biodiversity. Environmental heterogeneity and habitat connectivity among adjacent aquatic ecosystems may have positive implications in terms of regional environmental stability by enhancing the overall carrying capacity, i.e. the resilience to various forms of impact, contributing to biodiversity protection.Within these ecosystems, microbial processes encompass the entire basis of their primary production, in particular those driven by cyanobacteria. Combining a multi-disciplinary ecohydrological approach with a biogeochemical investigation of the principles underlying their functioning, our study can contribute to the development of appropriate environmental protection measures to effectively maintain their natural capital.",2067302535, IND605859652,Scholarly Journals," Water Research Institute, National Research Council (IRSA-CNR), Roma, Italy , Department of Evolutionary Biology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain , Department of Evolutionary Biology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain , Department of Earth Sciences, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy , Water Research Institute, National Research Council (IRSA-CNR), Roma, Italy , Department of Earth Sciences, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy , Department of Evolutionary Biology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain , Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Leicester, UK , Lake Naivasha Riparian Association, Kenya , Department of Environmental and Chemical Engineering, University of Calabria, Rende CS, Italy , Aquatic Ecosystem Services, Ltd., Drabblegate, Aylsham, Norfolk, United Kingdom , Water Research Institute, National Research Council (IRSA-CNR), Roma, Italy , Department of Evolutionary Biology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain","Fazi, Stefano;Butturini, Andrea;Tassi, Franco;Amalfitano, Stefano;Venturi, Stefania;Vazquez, Eusebi;Clokie, Martha;Wanjala, Silas W;Pacini, Nic;Harper, David M",,,," Fazi, Stefano , Water Research Institute, National Research Council (IRSA-CNR), Roma, Italy , Department of Evolutionary Biology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",,,, 10.1016/j.ecohyd.2017.09.003, Journal Article,,, Apr 2018,,,1642-3593,2, English, English,, p. 96-106,,Apr 2018,International journal of ecohydrology & hydrobiology, CSAPTjournals,2018, Elsevier B.V.," National Agricultural Library, © Elsevier B.V.",18,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/biogeochemistry-biodiversity-network-saline/docview/2067302535/se-2?accountid=14505," International journal of ecohydrology & hydrobiology, 2018 Apr., v. 18, no. 2, p. 96-106, Elsevier B.V., 1642-3593",,,,,,," International journal of ecohydrology & hydrobiology. 2018 Apr., v. 18, no. 2 Elsevier B.V.

Ecosystem metabolism of benthic and pelagic zones of a shallow productive estuary: spatio-temporal variability,"Long-term deterioration of water quality is known to reduce the importance of benthic ecosystem metabolism in shallow coastal ecosystems, but drivers of spatial and short-term variability in ecosystem metabolism are poorly understood. We addressed this knowledge gap through detailed seasonal measurements of ecosystem metabolism across depth gradients from shallow (2 to 3 m) eelgrass-dominated to deeper (4 to 5 m) muddy regions of a shallow, productive estuary. Combined measurements of gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R) and, by difference, net ecosystem production (NEP) by the open-water diel oxygen technique and in situ chamber incubations showed high importance of shallow eelgrass habitats for metabolism at the system scale. Seasonal variations in GPP, R and NEP increased with light availability and temperature with highest NEP in all habitats during the warm and sunny mid-summer. The shallow eelgrass-dominated and neighboring habitats were seasonally net autotrophic (NEP = 0.54 and 0.31 mg O 2 m -2 d -1 , respectively), compared to net heterotrophy (NEP = -0.26 mg O 2 m -2 d -1 ) at the deeper muddy site. Detailed studies along depth gradients further confirmed the role of eelgrass as a key driver of spatial differences in ecosystem metabolism across the estuary. Strong northerly winds (&gt;8 m s -1 ) caused short-term (&lt;24 h) periods of similar oxygen dynamics and similar apparent productivity in shallow and deeper waters, indicative of efficient lateral mixing, while calm periods (&lt;4 m s -1 ) enabled formation of ‘pockets’, i.e. water masses with limited connectivity, which exacerbated the metabolic differences between shallow and deep sites.",2100381185,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Bioscience, Aarhus University, Frederiksborgvej, 399, 4000 Roskilde, Denmark , Department of Bioscience, Aarhus University, Frederiksborgvej, 399, 4000 Roskilde, Denmark , Department of Bioscience, Aarhus University, Frederiksborgvej, 399, 4000 Roskilde, Denmark , Department of Bioscience, Aarhus University, Vejlsøvej 25, 8600 Silkeborg, Denmark , National Institute for Aquatic Resources, Technical University of Denmark, Building 202, Kemitorvet, 2800 Kgs.

"Analysis of Anthropogenic, Climatological, and Morphological Influences on Dissolved Organic Matter in Rocky Mountain Streams","In recent decades, the Rocky Mountains (RM) have undergone significant changes associated with anthropogenic activities and natural disturbances. These changes have the potential to alter primary productivity and biomass carbon storage. In particular, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in RM streams can affect heterotrophic processes, act as a source for the nutrient cycle, absorb sunlight radiation, alter metal transport, and can promote the production of carcinogenic byproducts during water treatment. Recent studies have focused on the relationship between bark beetle infestations and stream organic matter but have reached conflicting conclusions. Consequently, here we compile and process multiple datasets representing features of the RM for the period 1983-2012 with the purpose of assessing their relative influence on stream DOC concentrations using spatial statistical modeling. Features representing climate, land cover, forest disturbances, topography, soil types, and anthropogenic activities are included. We focus on DOC during base-flow conditions in RM streams because base-flow concentrations are more representative of the longer-term (annual to decadal) impacts and are less dependent on episodic, short-term storm and runoff/erosion events. To predict DOC throughout the network, we use a stream network model in a 56,550 km2 area to address the intrinsic connectivity and hydrologic directionality of the stream network. Natural forest disturbances are positively correlated with increased DOC concentrations; however, the effect of urbanization is far greater. Similarly, higher maximum temperatures, which can be exacerbated by climate change, are also associated with elevated DOC concentrations. Overall, DOC concentrations present an increasing trend over time in the RM region.",2040900453,,Scholarly Journals,,"Rodríguez-Jeangros, Nicolas;Hering, Amanda S;McCray, John E",,, Copyright MDPI AG 2018,,,,," Water 2018, 10(4), 534; 10.3390/w10040534", Journal Article,,, 2018,,,,4, English, English,,, Basel,2018,Water,,2018,,,10,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/analysis-anthropogenic-climatological/docview/2040900453/se-2?accountid=14505,,,,,,,,, 534,,," Urbanization , Bark , Byproducts , Mountains , Water treatment , Runoff , Carcinogens , Erosion , Nutrient transport , Soil types , Runoff , Runoff , Dissolved organic matter , Human influences , Radiation , Dissolved organic matter , Mountains , Erosion , Disturbances , Dissolved organic carbon , Urbanization , Forests , Metals , Climatology , Dissolved organic carbon , Dissolved organic matter , Primary production , Land use , Topography , Urbanization , Soils , Soil types , Organic matter , Storage , Anthropogenic factors , Runoff , Rivers , Nutrient cycles , Climate change , Byproducts , Dissolved organic carbon , Topography (geology) , Streams , Slopes (topography) , Water treatment , Land cover , Urbanization , Storms , Streams , Modelling , Water treatment , Forests , Climate models , Anthropogenic factors , Nutrient cycles , Carbon sequestration , Mountains , Nutrients (mineral) , Dissolved organic carbon , Mountain streams , Mathematical models , Bark , Dissolved organic matter , Water treatment , Climatic changes , Hydrology , Statistical models , Surface water , Water shortages , Climate change , Water quality , Carbon , Urbanization , Natural resources , Hydrology , Agriculture , Runoff , Carbon sequestration",,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Analysis+of+Anthropogenic%2C+Climatological%2C+and+Morphological+Influences+on+Dissolved+Organic+Matter+in+Rocky+Mountain+Streams&amp;author=Rodr%C3%ADguez-Jeangros%2C+Nicolas%3BHering%2C+Amanda+S%3BMcCray%2C+John+E&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=534&amp;date=2018&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Water&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aaqualine_,"Natural Science Collection,Publicly Available Content Database"

Reach-scale river metabolism across contrasting sub-catchment geologies; effect of light and hydrology,"We investigated the seasonal dynamics of in-stream metabolism at the reach scale ( approximately 150 m) of headwaters across contrasting geological sub-catchments: clay, Greensand, and Chalk of the upper River Avon (UK). Benthic metabolic activity was quantified by aquatic eddy co-variance while water column activity was assessed by bottle incubations. Seasonal dynamics across reaches were specific for the three types of geologies. During the spring, all reaches were net autotrophic, with rates of up to 290 mmol C m (super -2) d (super -1) in the clay reach. During the remaining seasons, the clay and Greensand reaches were net heterotrophic, with peak oxygen consumption of 206 mmol m (super -2) d (super -1) during the autumn, while the Chalk reach was net heterotrophic only in winter. Overall, the water column alone still contributed to approximately 25% of the annual respiration and primary production in all reaches. Net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) across seasons and reaches followed a general linear relationship with increasing stream light availability. Sub-catchment specific NEM proved to be linearly related to the local hydrological connectivity, quantified as the ratio between base flow and stream discharge, and expressed on a timescale of 9 d on average. This timescale apparently represents the average period of hydrological imprint for carbon turnover within the reaches. Combining a general light response and sub-catchment specific base flow ratio provided a robust functional relationship for predicting NEM at the reach scale. The novel approach proposed in this study can help facilitate spatial and temporal upscaling of riverine metabolism that may be applicable to a broader spectrum of catchments.

"Nitrogen Subsidies from Hillslope Alder Stands to Streamside Wetlands and Headwater Streams, Kenai Peninsula, Alaska","We examined nitrogen transport and wetland primary production along hydrologic flow paths that link nitrogen‐fixing alder ( Alnus spp.) stands to downslope wetlands and streams in the Kenai Lowlands, Alaska. We expected that nitrate concentrations in surface water and groundwater would be higher on flow paths below alder. We further expected that nitrate concentrations would be higher in surface water and groundwater at the base of short flow paths with alder and that streamside wetlands at the base of alder‐near flow paths would be less nitrogen limited than wetlands at the base of long flow paths with alder. Our results showed that groundwater nitrate‐N concentrations were significantly higher at alder‐near sites than at no‐alder sites, but did not differ significantly between alder‐far sites and no‐alder sites or between alder‐far sites and alder‐near sites. A survey of 15 N stable isotope signatures in soils and foliage in alder‐near and no‐alder flow paths indicated the alder‐derived nitrogen evident in soils below alder is quickly integrated downslope. Additionally, there was a significant difference in the relative increase in plant biomass after nitrogen fertilization, with the greatest increase occurring in the no‐alder sites. This study demonstrates that streamside wetlands and streams are connected to the surrounding landscapes through hydrologic flow paths, and flow paths with alder stands are potential “hot spots” for nitrogen subsidies at the hillslope scale.",2008908833,,Scholarly Journals," School of Geosciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida , Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, Edgewater, Maryland , School of Geosciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida , School of Geosciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida , Department of Biology, Baylor University, Waco, Texas , Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, Homer, Alaska , Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, Homer, Alaska , Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, Homer, Alaska","Callahan, Michael K;Whigham, Dennis F;Rains, Mark C;Rains, Kai C;King, Ryan S;Walker, Coowe M;Maurer, Jasmine R;Baird, Steven J",,, © 2017 American Water Resources Association,,,,, 10.1111/1752-1688.12508, Journal Article,,, Apr 2017,,,1093-474X,2, English, English,, 478-492, Middleburg,Apr 2017,Journal of the American Water Resources Association,,2017,,,53,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/nitrogen-subsidies-hillslope-alder-stands/docview/2008908833/se-2?accountid=14505,,,,,,,,, 478,,," Foliage , Subsidies , Flow , Nitrogen , Plant biomass , Primary production , Fertilization , Surface water , Wetlands , Nitrates , Groundwater , Nitrates , Groundwater , Wetlands , Surface water , Nitrogen , Nitrogen isotopes , Primary production , Stable isotopes , Wetlands , Soils , Ground water , Nitrates , Primary production , Subsidies , Surface water , Wetlands , Nitrates , Wetlands , Rivers , Foliage , Surveying , Streams , Stable isotopes , Headwaters , Subsidies (financial) , Streams , Nitrogen , Nitrogen , Groundwater , Lowlands , Foliage , Streams , Groundwater , Flow paths , Nitrogen , Biological fertilization , Surface water , Hydrology , Landscape , Soils , Alaska"," surface water/groundwater interactions , surface water hydrology , groundwater hydrology , watershed management , Alnus , Calamagrostis , connectivity , nitrogen , 15 N",,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Nitrogen+Subsidies+from+Hillslope+Alder+Stands+to+Streamside+Wetlands+and+Headwater+Streams%2C+Kenai+Peninsula%2C+Alaska&amp;author=Callahan%2C+Michael+K%3BWhigham%2C+Dennis+F%3BRains%2C+Mark+C%3BRains%2C+Kai+C%3BKing%2C+Ryan+S%3BWalker%2C+Coowe+M%3BMaurer%2C+Jasmine+R%3BBaird%2C+Steven+J&amp;volume=53&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=478&amp;date=2017&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+the+American+Water+Resources+Association&amp;issn=1093-474X&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagriculturejournals_,"Materials Science & Engineering Collection,Natural Science Collection"
"Limnophase versus potamophase: how hydrological connectivity affects the zooplankton community in an oxbow lake (Vistula River, Poland)","The functioning of oxbow lakes depends primarily on the succession of two phases: potamophase (when water from the river flows into the lake) and limnophase (when water remains in the riverbed, ensuring stability in the lake). Hydrologic conditions in the river determine whether oxbows are isolated or connected with the river. They also determine the time and duration of both phases. The studied oxbow lake, located in the floodplain of the lower Vistula, was created as the result of river regulation in the 19th century. Observations were conducted during growing seasons in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2013, during limnophase and potamophase. The study was aimed at evaluating the impact of changes in the river level on the oxbow lake. Potamophase brought greater zooplankton diversity. We recorded a higher number of species and a higher Shannon diversity index ( H ′). During limnophase, higher water temperature led to greater zooplankton density. However, its diversity decreased. In recent years, probably due to climate change, the amount of precipitation has decreased. As a result, water levels in rivers are lower and potamophase is rare, while periods of isolation are longer. Low water levels in oxbows increase their primary productivity and decrease zooplankton biodiversity.",2196538034,,Scholarly Journals,,"Napiórkowski, Paweł;Napiórkowska, Teresa",,," © 2017. Notwithstanding the ProQuest Terms and conditions, you may use this content in accordance with the associated terms available at https://www.limnology-journal.org/articles/limn/abs/2017/01/limn160073/limn160073.html .",,,,, 10.1051/limn/2017001, Journal Article,, 2017-02-27, 2017,,,0003-4088,, English, English,,, Les Ulis,2017,Annales de Limnologie,,2017,,,53,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/limnophase-versus-potamophase-how-hydrological/docview/2196538034/se-2,,,,,,,," 2016-11-16 (Received) , 2017-01-12 (Accepted)", n/a,,," Lakes , Zooplankton , Oxbow lakes , Rivers , Water levels , Rivers , Species diversity , Water temperature , Biodiversity , Climate change , Rivers , Water temperature , River beds , Oxbow lakes , Flood plains , Water levels , Oxbow lakes , Water levels , Water temperature , Zooplankton , Duration , Zooplankton , Water levels , Stability , Floodplains , Zooplankton , Primary production , Water temperature , Biodiversity , Rivers , Inland waters , River beds , Climatic changes , Hydrology , Biodiversity , Biodiversity"," Floodplain , River , Zooplankton , Diversity , Hydrology , Flood-pulse",,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Limnophase+versus+potamophase%3A+how+hydrological+connectivity+affects+the+zooplankton+community+in+an+oxbow+lake+%28Vistula+River%2C+Poland%29&amp;author=Napi%C3%B3rkowski%2C+Pawe%C5%82%3BNapi%C3%B3rkowska%2C+Teresa&amp;volume=53&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2017&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Annales+de+Limnologie&amp;issn=0003-4088&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aaqualine_,Natural Science Collection
Phytoplankton dynamics in the Congo River,"We report a dataset of phytoplankton in the Congo River, acquired along a 1700-km stretch in the mainstem during high water (HW, December 2013) and falling water (FW, June 2014). Samples for phytoplankton analysis were collected in the main river, in tributaries and one lake, and various relevant environmental variables were measured. Phytoplankton biomass and composition were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and marker pigments and by microscopy. Primary production measurements were made using the ¹³C incubation technique. In addition, data are also reported from a 19-month regular sampling (bi-monthly) at a fixed station in the mainstem of the upper Congo (at the city of Kisangani). Chl a concentrations differed between the two periods studied: in the mainstem, they varied between 0.07 and 1.77 µg L¹ in HW conditions and between 1.13 and 7.68 µg L¹ in FW conditions. The relative contribution to phytoplankton biomass from tributaries (mostly black waters) and from a few permanent lakes was low, and the main confluences resulted in phytoplankton dilution. Based on marker pigment concentration, green algae (both chlorophytes and streptophytes) dominated in the mainstem in HW, whereas diatoms dominated in FW; cryptophytes and cyanobacteria were more abundant but still relatively low in the FW period, both in the tributaries and in the main channel. Daily integrated production measured in the mainstem (n = 15) varied between 64.3 and 434.1 mg C m² day¹ in FW conditions and between 51.5 and 247.6 mg C m² day¹ in HW.

Hydrologic pulsing promotes spatial connectivity and food web subsidies in a subtropical coastal ecosystem,"Resource pulsing is a widespread phenomenon, but its effects on ecosystem dynamics are often difficult to predict. Hydrological pulsing, in particular, is known to influence the structure and dynamics of fluvial and coastal ecosystems, but little information is available about its effects on trophic connectivity between wetlands and estuaries. We investigated the hypothesis that hydrologic pulsing drives 1-way trophic subsidies (e.g. suspended organic matter and freshwater fish) from wetland to estuary. Our study system is a coastal lagoon with an ephemeral mouth that, when closed, stores freshwater as a sustained flood pulse that is subsequently released when a connection with the sea is reestablished. We monitored isotopic composition of consumers and food sources over the course of an entire flood pulse to infer trophic linkages and spatial subsidies. Before the flood peak (April and May), freshwater and estuarine zones were largely dependent on local primary production sources (seston and C sub(3) plants vs. C sub(4) plants and microphytobenthos, respectively), essentially functioning as disconnected compartments. A sustained pulse of freshwater inflow (June to August) induced greater habitat connectivity and a net flow of biomass and energy from the freshwater zone into the estuarine zone. The opening of the lagoon outlet channel abruptly terminated the flood pulse and reduced freshwater subsidies to estuarine consumers, and both zones returned to dependence on autochthonous production. Our findings contribute to current concerns that artificial opening of sandbars in coastal lagoons alters natural ecological dynamics with significant effects on biodiversity and ecosystem processes.",1881748793, PQ0004192859,Scholarly Journals,,"Garcia, A M;Winemiller, K O;Hoeinghaus, D J;Claudino, M C;Bastos, R;Correa, F;Huckembeck, S;Vieira, J;Loebmann, D;Abreu, P;Ducatti, C",,,," Garcia, A M",,,, 10.3354/meps12060, Journal Article, 1616-1599,,"  0, 2017",,,0171-8630,, English, English,, 17-28,,"0, 2017",Marine Ecology Progress Series, CSAPTjournals,2017," Inter-Research, Nordbuente 23 Oldendorf/Luhe 21385 Germany",,567,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/hydrologic-pulsing-promotes-spatial-connectivity/docview/1881748793/se-2?accountid=14505," Marine Ecology Progress Series.

Phytoplankton dynamics in the Congo River,"1. We report a dataset of phytoplankton in the Congo River, acquired along a 1700-km stretch in the mainstem during high water (HW, December 2013) and falling water (FW, June 2014). Samples for phytoplankton analysis were collected in the main river, in tributaries and one lake, and various relevant environmental variables were measured. Phytoplankton biomass and composition were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and marker pigments and by microscopy. Primary production measurements were made using the super(13)C incubation technique. In addition, data are also reported from a 19-month regular sampling (bi-monthly) at a fixed station in the mainstem of the upper Congo (at the city of Kisangani). 2. Chl a concentrations differed between the two periods studied: in the mainstem, they varied between 0.07 and 1.77 mu g L super(-1) in HW conditions and between 1.13 and 7.68 mu g L super(-1) in FW conditions. The relative contribution to phytoplankton biomass from tributaries (mostly black waters) and from a few permanent lakes was low, and the main confluences resulted in phytoplankton dilution. Based on marker pigment concentration, green algae (both chlorophytes and streptophytes) dominated in the mainstem in HW, whereas diatoms dominated in FW; cryptophytes and cyanobacteria were more abundant but still relatively low in the FW period, both in the tributaries and in the main channel. 3. Daily integrated production measured in the mainstem (n = 15) varied between 64.3 and 434.1 mg C m super(-2) day super(-1) in FW conditions and between 51.5 and 247.6 mg C m super(-2) day super(-1) in HW.

Trophic connectivity and basal food sources sustaining tropical aquatic consumers along a mangrove to ocean gradient,"Variations in the relative importance of autotrophic sources to aquatic consumers along environmental gradients and the trophic role of mangrove-derived detritus to marine coastal food webs are still poorly investigated in tropical systems. In this study, we employed stable isotope analyses to investigate the relative importance of basal food sources to macroconsumers (decapod crustaceans and fishes) in a tropical estuary along an environmental gradient extending from the mangroves to the ocean. Additionally, we evaluated the 'outwelling hypothesis', which hypothesizes that mangrove-derived detritus exported to the adjacent marine area is a food source for marine macroconsumers at open and reef-protected sandy beaches. Primary producers and macroconsumers (62 and 214 samples, respectively) were collected at five locations across the main longitudinal axis of the Mamanguape estuary, a tropical Southwestern Atlantic estuary. There were marked shifts in carbon and nitrogen isotope values for both food sources and consumers along the estuarine-marine gradient, and the mixing model results revealed similar patterns of assimilation of basal food sources by decapod crustaceans and fishes. In the inner section of the estuary, consumers tended to assimilated nutrients derived mainly from mangrove and macroalgae, whereas nearer the mouth of the estuary and in the adjacent marine area they assimilated nutrients derived mainly from macroalgae, seagrass and organic matter in the sediment (SOM). These findings support the hypothesis that the relative importance of basal food sources to macroconsumers in this tropical estuarine system reflects the dominant autochthonous primary production at each location. In contrast, our results did not support the outwelling hypothesis that mangrove-originated detritus, in the form of senescent mangrove leaves, makes a significant contribution as a primary source of carbon to high-order consumers inhabiting adjacent ocean sandy beaches.",1753464381, PQ0002418601,Scholarly Journals,,"Claudino, Marlucy Coelho;Pessanha, Andre Luiz Machado;Araujo, Francisco Gerson;Garcia, Alexandre Miranda",,,," Claudino, Marlucy Coelho",,,, 10.1016/j.ecss.2015.07.005, Journal Article,,, December 2015,,,0272-7714,, English, English,, 45-55,,December 2015,"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science", CSAPTjournals,2015," Elsevier B.V., P.O.

Trends in a satellite-derived vegetation index and environmental variables in a restored brackish lagoon,"We evaluated relative influence of climatic variables on the plant productivity after lagoon restoration. Chilika Lagoon, the largest brackish lake ecosystem in East Asia, experienced severe problems such as excessive dominance of freshwater exotic plants and rapid debasement of biodiversity associated with decreased hydrologic connectivity between the lagoon and the ocean. To halt the degradation of the lagoon ecosystem, the Chilika Development Authority implemented a restoration project, creating a new channel to penetrate the barrier beach of the lagoon. Using a satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset, we compared the trend of vegetation changes after the lagoon restoration, from April 1998 to May 2014. The time series of NDVI data were decomposed into trend, seasonal, and random components using a local regression method. The results were visualized to understand the traits of spatial distribution in the lagoon. The NDVI trend, indicative of primary productivity, decreased rapidly during the restoration period, and gradually increased (slope coefficient: 2.1×10−4, p&lt;0.05) after two years of restoration. Level of seawater exchange had more influences on plant productivity than local precipitation in the restored lagoon. Higher El Niño/Southern Oscillation increased sea level pressure, and caused intrusion of seawater into the lagoon, and the subsequently elevated salinity decreased the annual mean NDVI. Our findings suggest that lagoon restoration plans for enhancing interconnectivity with the ocean should consider oceanographic effects due to meteorological forcing, and long-term NDVI results can be used as a valuable index for adaptive management of the restoration site.",2000408871, IND605446602,Scholarly Journals," Wetland Research and Training Centre, Chilika Development Authority, Barkul Balugaon Khurda 752030, India , Wetland Research and Training Centre, Chilika Development Authority, Barkul Balugaon Khurda 752030, India , Department of Physical and Environmental Sciences, University of Toronto, Ontario M1C 1A4, Canada , Department of Integrated Biological Science, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 609-735, South Korea , Wetland Research and Training Centre, Chilika Development Authority, Barkul Balugaon Khurda 752030, India , Wetland Research and Training Centre, Chilika Development Authority, Barkul Balugaon Khurda 752030, India , Wetland Research and Training Centre, Chilika Development Authority, Barkul Balugaon Khurda 752030, India , Department of Integrated Biological Science, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 609-735, South Korea , Wetland Research and Training Centre, Chilika Development Authority, Barkul Balugaon Khurda 752030, India","Kim, Ji Yoon;Pattnaik, Ajit K;Dong-Kyun, Kim;Gea-Jae Joo;Rastogi, Gurdeep;Muduli, Pradipta R;Samal, Rabindra N;Do, Yuno",,,," Kim, Ji Yoon , Wetland Research and Training Centre, Chilika Development Authority, Barkul Balugaon Khurda 752030, India",,,, 10.1016/j.gecco.2015.10.010, Journal Article,,, Jul 2015,,,2351-9894,, English, English,, p. 614-624,,Jul 2015,Global ecology and conservation, CSAPTjournals,2015, Elsevier B.V.," National Agricultural Library, © Elsevier B.V.",4,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/trends-satellite-derived-vegetation-index/docview/2000408871/se-2?accountid=14505," Global ecology and conservation, 2015 July, v. 4, p. 614-624, Elsevier B.V., 2351-9894",,,,,,," Global ecology and conservation. 2015 July, v. 4 Elsevier B.V. , Available from publisher's site", 614,,," adaptive management , biodiversity , climatic factors , data collection , ecosystems , El Nino , freshwater , introduced plants , lakes , normalized difference vegetation index , primary productivity , regression analysis , salinity , sea level , seawater , time series analysis , vegetation , East Asia , East Asia"," Ecological restoration , El Niño/Southern oscillation , Resilience , SPOT NDVI , Trend , article , article",,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Trends+in+a+satellite-derived+vegetation+index+and+environmental+variables+in+a+restored+brackish+lagoon&amp;author=Kim%2C+Ji+Yoon%3BPattnaik%2C+Ajit+K%3BDong-Kyun%2C+Kim%3BGea-Jae+Joo%3BRastogi%2C+Gurdeep%3BMuduli%2C+Pradipta+R%3BSamal%2C+Rabindra+N%3BDo%2C+Yuno&amp;volume=4&amp;issue=&amp;spage=614&amp;date=2015&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Global+ecology+and+conservation&amp;issn=2351-9894&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagricolamodule_IND605446602,Natural Science Collection
Ecohydrology in semiarid urban ecosystems; modeling the relationship between connected impervious area and ecosystem productivity,"In water-stressed, semiarid urban environments, connections between impervious surfaces and drainage networks may strongly impact the water use and ecosystem productivity of neighboring vegetated areas. We use an ecohydrologic model, the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys), to quantify the sensitivity of vegetation water use and net primary productivity (NPP) to fine-scale impervious surface connectivity. We develop a set of very fine-scale (2 m (super 2) ) scenarios that vary both the percentage of impervious surface and fraction of this impervious surface with direct hydrologic connections to urban drainage systems for a small hillslope. When driven by Mediterranean climate forcing, model estimates suggest that total vegetation water use declines with increasing impervious area. However, when impervious area is hydrologically disconnected from the urban drainage network, declines in water and carbon fluxes with decreased vegetated area can be partially, or in some cases even completely, offset by increased transpiration and NPP in the remaining vegetation. Relative increases in water use and NPP of remaining vegetation are much greater for deeply rooted shrubs and trees and negligible for shallow rooted grasses. We extrapolate our findings to the catchment scale by developing a first-order approximation of fine-scale impervious connection impacts on aggregate watershed water and carbon flux estimates. Our approach offers a computationally and data-efficient method for estimating the impact of impervious area connectivity on these ecohydrologic fluxes. For our only partially urbanized Santa Barbara watershed, estimates of water use and NPP that account for fine-scale impervious connection differed by more than 10% from those that did not.

Ecohydrology in semiarid urban ecosystems: Modeling the relationship between connected impervious area and ecosystem productivity,"In water-stressed, semiarid urban environments, connections between impervious surfaces and drainage networks may strongly impact the water use and ecosystem productivity of neighboring vegetated areas. We use an ecohydrologic model, the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys), to quantify the sensitivity of vegetation water use and net primary productivity (NPP) to fine-scale impervious surface connectivity. We develop a set of very fine-scale (2 m2) scenarios that vary both the percentage of impervious surface and fraction of this impervious surface with direct hydrologic connections to urban drainage systems for a small hillslope. When driven by Mediterranean climate forcing, model estimates suggest that total vegetation water use declines with increasing impervious area. However, when impervious area is hydrologically disconnected from the urban drainage network, declines in water and carbon fluxes with decreased vegetated area can be partially, or in some cases even completely, offset by increased transpiration and NPP in the remaining vegetation. Relative increases in water use and NPP of remaining vegetation are much greater for deeply rooted shrubs and trees and negligible for shallow rooted grasses. We extrapolate our findings to the catchment scale by developing a first-order approximation of fine-scale impervious connection impacts on aggregate watershed water and carbon flux estimates. Our approach offers a computationally and data-efficient method for estimating the impact of impervious area connectivity on these ecohydrologic fluxes. For our only partially urbanized Santa Barbara watershed, estimates of water use and NPP that account for fine-scale impervious connection differed by more than 10% from those that did not.",1655479873,,Scholarly Journals,,"Shields, Catherine;Tague, Christina",,, © 2015.

"Hydrologic fragmentation-induced eutrophication in Dove Sound, Upper Florida Keys, USA","Anthropogenic impacts to island systems can have deleterious effects on coastal aquatic ecosystems. These effects can alter water quality, primary production as well as habitat. Land development often fragments hydrologic connectivity within aquatic ecosystems forcing alterations in nutrient transport and increases the potential for eutrophication.

"Persistence of clear-water, shallow-lake ecosystems: the role of protected areas and stable aquatic food webs","The roles of both landscape alteration and in-lake processes need to be considered in conservation strategies for shallow lakes in the prairie regions of North America. Here we focus on shallow lakes in west-central Minnesota, USA, highlighting the long-term ecological history and response to known landscape changes of a clear-water, macrophyte-dominated, shallow lake. Contemporary limnological data suggest the aquatic ecosystem has been very stable and fishless for the last ~15 years. Sediment proxies for primary production and ecological change confirm that a stable ecosystem likely prevailed for the last ~200 years. However, sedimentary indicators of catchment erosion detail a distinct response to land-use change during the conversion of native grassland to agricultural land, and following establishment of a protected waterfowl production area (WPA) around the lake. Post-WPA, the rate of sediment accrual decreased dramatically within 5-10 years and sources of organic matter were similar to those of the pre-settlement period. The aquatic ecosystem has been able to withstand nutrient enrichment and allochthonous inputs because stable trophic interactions have likely been in place for more than 200 years. We conclude that lack of hydrologic connectivity and isolated, small catchments are important factors in the promotion of clear-water shallow lake ecosystems, mainly because they prevent colonization by fish and associated ecological consequences.

Linkages between hydrogeomorphology and nutrient availability in wetlands,"Hydrogeomorphology is an important determinant of nutrient transport, cycling, and availability in wetlands. Fluvial geomorphic position in the landscape can influence the connectivity of wetlands to flowing water, thereby affecting the inputs of nutrients to the wetland, and ultimately controlling biogeochemical transformations. Similarly, internal geomorphic heterogeneity (microtopography) can influence soil wetness within the wetland and biogeochemistry. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs and soil biogeochemical transformations were measured across a range of wetland ecosystems, including floodplain wetlands, tidal freshwater wetlands, and created wetlands. Nitrogen and P inputs from sedimentation and inorganic ion loading to the soil surface were greater at locations with greater connectivity to river water. Nutrient inputs from sedimentation also vary across broad landscape gradients from nontidal, tidal freshwater, and tidal oligohaline wetlands. Both N and P mineralization in wetland soils increased with N and P inputs. Thus, greater hydrologic connectivity (as influenced by landscape position and river-wetland geomorphology) stimulates nutrient availability for primary production, other biogeochemical processes, and ecosystem nutrient retention. Furthermore, microtopographic heterogeneity within wetlands stimulated nutrient availability and retention. In tidal freshwater wetlands, hummocks were hotspots of soil nitrification relative to low lying hollows. In created wetlands, building microtopography during construction resulted in greater soil nitrification and denitrification. In conclusion, geomorphology and hydrology at multiple scales influence the inputs, biogeochemical transformations, and availability of nutrients in wetland ecosystems.",2366757336, 2014-073653,Scholarly Journals, U.

A vital link: water and vegetation in the Anthropocene,"This paper argues that the interplay of water, carbon and vegetation dynamics fundamentally links some global trends in the current and conceivable future Anthropocene, such as cropland expansion, freshwater use, and climate change and its impacts. Based on a review of recent literature including geographically explicit simulation studies with the process-based LPJmL global biosphere model, it demonstrates that the connectivity of water and vegetation dynamics is vital for water security, food security and (terrestrial) ecosystem dynamics alike. The water limitation of net primary production of both natural and agricultural plants - already pronounced in many regions - is shown to increase in many places under projected climate change, though this development is partially offset by water-saving direct CO sub(2) effects. Natural vegetation can to some degree adapt dynamically to higher water limitation, but agricultural crops usually require some form of active management to overcome it - among them irrigation, soil conservation and eventually shifts of cropland to areas that are less water-limited due to more favourable climatic conditions. While crucial to secure food production for a growing world population, such human interventions in water-vegetation systems have, as also shown, repercussions on the water cycle. Indeed, land use changes are shown to be the second-most important influence on the terrestrial water balance in recent times. Furthermore, climate change (warming and precipitation changes) will in many regions increase irrigation demand and decrease water availability, impeding rainfed and irrigated food production (if not CO sub(2) effects counterbalance this impact - which is unlikely at least in poorly managed systems). Drawing from these exemplary investigations, some research perspectives on how to further improve our knowledge of human-water-vegetation interactions in the Anthropocene are outlined.",1464514962, 18792299,Scholarly Journals,,"Gerten, D",,,," Gerten, D",,,, 10.5194/hess-17-3841-2013, Journal Article, 1607-7938,," October 9, 2013",,,1027-5606,10, English, English,, 3841-3852,,"October 9, 2013",Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, CSAPTjournals,2013," European Geosciences Union, c/o E.O.S.T.

Temperature and precipitation drive temporal variability in aquatic carbon and GHG concentrations and fluxes in a peatland catchment,"The aquatic pathway is increasingly being recognized as an important component of catchment carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets, particularly in peatland systems due to their large carbon store and strong hydrological connectivity. In this study, we present a complete 5-year data set of all aquatic carbon and GHG species from an ombrotrophic Scottish peatland. Measured species include particulate and dissolved forms of organic carbon (POC, DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2, CH4 and N2O. We show that short-term variability in concentrations exists across all species and this is strongly linked to discharge. Seasonal cyclicity was only evident in DOC,CO2 and CH4 concentration; however, temperature correlated with monthly means in all species except DIC. Although the temperature correlation with monthly DOC and POC concentrations appeared to be related to biological productivity in the terrestrial system, we suggest the temperature correlation with CO2 and CH4 was primarily due to in-stream temperature-dependent solubility. Interannual variability in total aquatic carbon concentration was strongly correlated with catchment gross primary productivity (GPP) indicating a strong potential terrestrial aquatic linkage. DOC represented the largest aquatic carbon flux term (19.3 plus or minus 4.59 g C m-2 yr-1), followed by CO2 evasion (10.0 g C m-2 yr-1). Despite an estimated contribution to the total aquatic carbon flux of between 8 and 48%, evasion estimates had the greatest uncertainty. Interannual variability in total aquatic carbon export was low in comparison with variability in terrestrial biosphere-atmosphere exchange, and could be explained primarily by temperature and precipitation. Our results therefore suggest that climatic change is likely to have a significant impact on annual carbon losses through the aquatic pathway, and as such, aquatic exports are fundamental to the understanding of whole catchment responses to climate change.",1372057943, 18142794,Scholarly Journals,,"Dinsmore, K J;Billett, M F;Dyson, KE",,,," Dinsmore, K J",,,, 10.1111/gcb.12209, Journal Article, 1365-2486,, July 2013,,,1354-1013,7, English, English,, 2133-2148,,July 2013,Global Change Biology, CSAPTjournals,2013," Wiley-Blackwell, 111 River Street Hoboken NJ 07030-5774 United States",,19,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/temperature-precipitation-drive-temporal/docview/1372057943/se-2?accountid=14505," Global Change Biology [Global Change Biol.].

Environmental factors affecting incorporation of terrestrial material into large river food webs,"Three enduring conceptual models make predictions regarding the basal production sources supporting the upper food web of rivers: the River Continuum Concept, the Flood Pulse Concept, and the Riverine Productivity Model. Sources of primary production supporting metazoan biomass might best be understood by using a pluralistic approach that views basal sources as a dependent variable and key physicochemical and hydrological factors as independent variables. Here, I review studies in which chemical markers (stable-isotope and fatty-acid analyses) were used to estimate dominant primary producers contributing to consumer biomass in large rivers and evaluate associated independent variables (e.g., hydrologic regime, turbidity, concentration of dissolved organic matter, floodplain vegetation, lateral connectivity, and upstream impoundment) that have been hypothesized to contribute to variation in basal production sources. My review shows that C₄ grasses rarely support riverine metazoans and that algae are the predominant source of C supporting upper trophic levels of large rivers worldwide. However, I also found that many consumers assimilate material from C(3) plants in rivers with high sediment loads and low transparency during high-flow pulses. Exceptions to this pattern occur when river reaches are downstream from an impoundment, in which case, algae assume greater importance. Terrestrial C(3) plants also subsidize consumers in rivers with high dissolved organic matter concentrations via the microbial loop and, in other rivers, after periods of high discharge or leaf fall that increase the amount of terrestrial material in the particulate organic matter pool. I highlight the natural causes of differences in turbidity and dissolved organic matter among large rivers and the importance of transported materials as a source of nutrients for ecologically and economically important fish species.",1753433423, IND601283080,Scholarly Journals,,"Roach, Katherine A",,,," Roach, Katherine A",,,, 10.1899/12-063.1, Journal Article,,, Mar 2013,,,2161-9565,1, English, English,, p. 283-298,,Mar 2013,Freshwater science, CSAPTjournals,2013, North American Benthological Society," National Agricultural Library, © North American Benthological Society",32,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/environmental-factors-affecting-incorporation/docview/1753433423/se-2?accountid=14505," Freshwater science, 2013 Mar., v. 32, no. 1, p. 283-298, North American Benthological Society, 2161-9565",,,,,,," Freshwater science. 2013 Mar., v. 32, no. 1 North American Benthological Society , Available from publisher's site", 283,,," Algae , Animalia , C3 plants , C4 plants , biomass , dissolved organic matter , environmental factors , fish , floodplains , food webs , hydrologic factors , leaves , materials , models , nutrients , pollution load , prediction , primary productivity , rivers , sediment yield , stable isotopes , turbidity , vegetation"," article , food web , large river , isotopes , riverine productivity model , flood pulse concept , river continuum concept , article",,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Environmental+factors+affecting+incorporation+of+terrestrial+material+into+large+river+food+webs&amp;author=Roach%2C+Katherine+A&amp;volume=32&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=283&amp;date=2013&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Freshwater+science&amp;issn=2161-9565&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagricolamodule_IND601283080,Natural Science Collection

The role of hydrologic connections between impervious surfaces and vegetated patches in semi-arid urban environments,"Urban environments are characterized by fine-scale heterogeneity, with patches of impervious surface and vegetation. In semi-arid regions where precipitation patterns are episodic, this fine scale structure may be a significant control on both storm-event runoff and seasonal water yields. From an ecological perspective, the productivity of urban vegetated patches is often limited by available water or is supported by irrigation inputs. Hydrologic connections between fine-scale impervious-surfaces and urban vegetation may influence not only runoff but also useable water for urban vegetation. Semi-arid natural ecosystems are also often characterized by fine scale vegetated - bare soil patch structures and hydrologic connections between these patches has been shown to be a significant control on shrub and forest productivity. In this paper we use an ecohydrologic model, RHESSys, to quantify the sensitivity of vegetation water use, net primary productivity and runoff to fine scale impervious surface connections in a semi arid urban settings. We use simulations on a theoretical hillslope where we can systematically vary impervious surface-vegetation fractions as well as connectivity between these patches to examine sensitivity of runoff, vegetation water use and productivity for a range of semi-arid climate forcing. We combine this analysis with watershed scale models for sites in Santa Barbara and San Diego, California to develop a first-order approximation of the potential impact of accounting for fine scale impervious connections on aggregate watershed ecohydrologic flux estimates. Results indicate that while large increases in impervious surfaces will reduce transpiration and photosynthesis, due to the sheer loss of vegetated area, the effect of decreased vegetated area can be partially or in some cases even completely offset by increased transpiration and productivity in the remaining vegetation that occurs when water is routed from impervious to vegetated areas. These results highlight the importance of accounting for fine-scale heterogeneity and hydrologic connections between patches. We conclude by presenting a modelling framework that can be used to account for these interactions.",2366211105, 2013-077208,Scholarly Journals," University of California at Santa Barbara, Bren School of Environmental Science and Management","Tague, Christina;Shields, Catherine;Anonymous", GAAPBC," Geological Society of America, 2012 annual meeting"," GeoRef, Copyright 2020, American Geosciences Institute.

Biogeochemistry of Carbon in the Amazonian Floodplains over a 2000-km Reach: Insights from a Process-Based Model,"  The influence of Amazonian floodplains on the hydrological, sedimentary, and biogeochemical river budget was investigated over a 2000-km reach. A process-based model relying on the closure of chemical fluxes and isotopic signals was implemented. On average for the whole studied reach, the overall fluxes of carbon associated with mineralization and aquatic photosynthesis were estimated to 35.7 and 15.3 Tg C yr -1 , respectively. Almost 57% of the carbon sequestrated by photosynthesis comes from aerial sources (flooded forest); the remaining 43% resulted from aquatic sources (várzea grasses and phytoplankton). The process rates substantially fluctuate over the annual cycle, depending particularly on the extension of flooded area and on the river-floodplain connectivity. As the river level declines, the drastic decrease of turbidity and the lower supply of carbon substrates promote autotrophy to the detriment of heterotrophy, leading to substantial changes of pH and gaseous equilibria in the river water. The main consequences are (i) the side-chain oxidation of dissolved organic matter leading to the concomitant rises of the carbon to nitrogen atomic ratio and nitrate contents and (ii) the sorption of hydrophobic humic acids, which fractionate 13 C and thus lead to 13 C-depleted particulate organic matter (fine fraction) compared to remaining dissolved organic matter. As the river flow rises, the heterotrophy prevails over autotrophy and this tends to attenuate the chemical signature imprinted by the latter. The significant contribution of aerial autochthonous sources to the budget of carbon indicates that the fluxes of mineralization are sustained by the net primary production of river corridors. The variable extension of submerged areas defines the proportions of CO 2 exported by the river and released to the atmosphere. The rate of CO 2 outgassing on the studied reach (18.8 Tg C yr -1 ) represents about 50% of the incoming dissolved inorganic carbon flux. The rate of methane emission is estimated as 2.2 Tg C yr -1 and that of denitrification is estimated as 0.87 Tg N yr -1 , representing 1.5 times the flux of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) exported by the Amazon River at the station of Óbidos (0.64 Tg N yr -1 ).",851503725,,Scholarly Journals,,"Jose Mauro Sousa de Moura,@ Daniel de Castro Victoria,&amp; Andre Marcondes Andrade Toledo,, Vincent;Colicchio++, Erich",,, American Meteorological Society 2011,,,,, 10.1175/2010EI338.1, Feature,,, Jan 2011,,,,4, English, English,, n/a, Washington,Jan 2011,Earth Interactions,,2011,,,15,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/biogeochemistry-carbon-amazonian-floodplains-over/docview/851503725/se-2,,,,,,,,, 1,,," Biogeochemistry , Floodplains , Carbon , Rainforests , Carbon sequestration , Amazon Basin",,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Biogeochemistry+of+Carbon+in+the+Amazonian+Floodplains+over+a+2000-km+Reach%3A+Insights+from+a+Process-Based+Model&amp;author=Jose+Mauro+Sousa+de+Moura%2C%40+Daniel+de+Castro+Victoria%2C%26amp%3B+Andre+Marcondes+Andrade+Toledo%2C%2C+Vincent%3BColicchio%2B%2B%2C+Erich&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=1&amp;date=2011&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Earth+Interactions&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aasfaocean_,Natural Science Collection
Genetic diversity and connectivity of deep-sea hydrothermal vent metapopulations,"AbstractDeep-sea hydrothermal vents provide ephemeral habitats for animal communities that depend on chemosynthetic primary production.

Longitudinal spatial variation in ecological conditions in an in-channel floodplain river system during flow pulses,"A field survey was conducted during flow pulses to investigate the longitudinal spatial patterns in water quality, dissolved inorganic and organic matter, phytoplankton, planktonic bacteria, zooplankton, gross primary productivity (GPP) of phytoplankton and planktonic respiration (PR) in channels of the large floodplain system (˜¼124 km in length) of the Macquarie Marshes, south-eastern Australia. Four river reaches (areas) with distinct hydrogeomorphological characteristics within the distributary zone of the lower Macquarie River were chosen for analysis of abiotic and biotic variables in their in-stream environments. The results showed marked longitudinal spatial variation in the values within and among the measured environmental variables including such functional aspects as primary productivity and PR. The variables that tended to have increasing values in a downstream direction were conductivity, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), dissolved silica, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP), ratio of DOC/DON and counts of planktonic bacteria. Conversely, the values that tended to decrease downstream were the ratios of TN/TP, DIN/DRP, DOC/DOP, DON/DOP and GPP/PR. Variables that had a localized peak(s) were dissolved oxygen, turbidity, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, GPP, PR and counts of cyanobacteria, diatoms, green algae, cryptomonads, protozoans, rotifers, copepods and cladocerans. Overall, two distinct ecological zones were identified within the broader distributary functional process zone (FPZ): these being the upstream zone with relatively high levels of DO, turbidity, diatoms and GPP/PR ratio, and the downstream zone with relatively high levels of nutrients, dissolved organic matter, cyanobacteria, planktonic bacteria, protozoans and cladocerans. The results of this study describe the spatial connectivity of ecological processes related to hydrogeomorphological factors within a FPZ of a riverine ecosystem, and support the predictions of the riverine ecosystem synthesis framework that ecological patterns and processes can be discontinuous on a longitudinal spatial scale.

Influences of Multi-Scale Habitat on Metabolism in a Coastal Great Lakes Watershed,"Spatial heterogeneity influences ecosystem structure and function across multiple habitat scales. Although primary production and respiration are fundamental to energy cycling in aquatic ecosystems, we know relatively little about how habitat scale influences metabolism. In this study, we adopted a multi-scale habitat approach to evaluate primary production and respiration in a coastal Great Lakes watershed that is experiencing pressure from past, present, and anticipated future human activities. We divided the watershed into five macrohabitats (stream, river, wetland, drowned-river mouth lake, and Great Lake), two mesohabitats (benthic and water column), and four microhabitats (periphytic substrates: sand/sediment, rock, wood, and plant) for evaluation of spatial patterns and synchrony in metabolism. Factors that influenced patterns of metabolism were scale dependent. Algal biomass strongly influenced spatial patterns in metabolism at the meso- and microhabitat scales; greater algal biomass translated to higher areal-specific and lower chlorophyll-specific metabolism at benthic mesohabitat and sand/sediment and rock microhabitats. Benthic metabolism overwhelmed water column metabolism, irrespective of location or time of year. Watershed position was important at the macrohabitat scale, with greater overall metabolism in macrohabitats located lower in the watershed. Average synchrony in metabolism rates was greatest at the macrohabitat scale, suggesting metabolic patterns that are evident at finer scales may become integrated at coarser scales. Our results (1) show that spatial and temporal patterns in metabolism are shaped by factors that are dependent upon habitat scale; (2) highlight the importance of benthic productivity across habitat and season; and (3) suggest that hydrologic connectivity strongly influences ecosystem processes, although physical factors can affect these responses as evidenced by the low levels of synchrony between Lake Michigan and the other macrohabitats.",746300493, 12596421,Scholarly Journals,,"Ogdahl, Mary E;Lougheed, Vanessa L;Stevenson, RJan;Steinman, Alan D",,,," Ogdahl, Mary E",,,, 10.1007/s10021-009-9312-y, Journal Article, 1435-0629,, March 2010,,,1432-9840,2, English, English,, 222-238,,March 2010,Ecosystems, CSAPTjournals,2010," Springer-Verlag, Tiergartenstrasse 17 Heidelberg 69121 Germany",,13,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/influences-multi-scale-habitat-on-metabolism/docview/746300493/se-2?accountid=14505," Ecosystems [Ecosystems].

Our results (1) show that spatial and temporal patterns in metabolism are shaped by factors that are dependent upon habitat scale; (2) highlight the importance of benthic productivity across habitat and season; and (3) suggest that hydrologic connectivity strongly influences ecosystem processes, although physical factors can affect these responses as evidenced by the low levels of synchrony between Lake Michigan and the other macrohabitats.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",210422596,,Scholarly Journals,,"Ogdahl, Mary E;Lougheed, Vanessa L;Stevenson, R Jan;Steinman, Alan D",,," Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010",,,,, 10.1007/s10021-009-9312-y, Feature,,, Mar 2010,,,1432-9840,2, English, English,, 222-238, New York,Mar 2010,Ecosystems,,2010,,,13,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/influences-multi-scale-habitat-on-metabolism/docview/210422596/se-2?accountid=14505,,,,, References,,,, 222,,," Habitats , Watersheds , Ecosystems , Metabolism , Human influences , Plankton",,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Influences+of+Multi-Scale+Habitat+on+Metabolism+in+a+Coastal+Great+Lakes+Watershed&amp;author=Ogdahl%2C+Mary+E%3BLougheed%2C+Vanessa+L%3BStevenson%2C+R+Jan%3BSteinman%2C+Alan+D&amp;volume=13&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=222&amp;date=2010&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Ecosystems&amp;issn=1432-9840&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aecology_,Natural Science Collection
"Phytoplankton dynamics in relation to connectivity, flow dynamics and resource availability--the case of a large, lowland river, the Hungarian Tisza","Large lowland rivers with sufficient hydrological storage capacity are capable of supporting primary production, but the dynamics of the advecting phytoplankton is poorly understood. Our study aimed at exploring how longitudinal versus lateral connectivity, flow dynamics versus resource availability and continuous versus discontinuous environmental gradients shaped the species composition of phytoplankton. Samples were taken from February to October 2000 along the Hungarian Tisza River (HTR) and in its main tributaries. Longitudinal and seasonal patterns were related to resources (light and nutrients) availability and flow dynamics derived from a 1D hydrodynamic model. The HTR was autotrophic during the study period, but tributary input considerably exceeded net autochtonous production. The Szamos River was the major source of both phytoplankton and nutrients in the HTR. Chryso- and euglenophytes were flushed into the main river from floodplain oxbows during high discharge. Imported algae experienced discontinuity in environmental gradients when entering the main river. The merged impact areas of two dams (IAD) that separate the two large meandering patches of the HTR disrupted the longitudinal profiles of both physico-chemical variables and attributes of algal assemblages (biomass, species composition, richness, similarity between adjacent sampling sites). Hydraulic storage along the IAD selectively favoured the recruitment of cryptophytes that, however, could not compensate for the enhanced sedimentation of diatoms in terms of biomass. Although the meandering patches presented several small-scale differences in major environmental gradients, both patches supported the growth of planktonic diatoms. Changes in algal biomass were decoupled from nutrient availability. We conclude that various measures must be applied in various lowland rivers within the same catchment to control their trophic status as a component of the 'good ecological status' defined in the Water Framework Directive.",860388126, 14393379,Scholarly Journals,,"Istvanovics, Vera;Honti, Mark;Voeroes, Lajos;Kozma, Zsolt",,,," Istvanovics, Vera",,,, 10.1007/s10750-009-9991-6, Journal Article, 1573-5117,, January 2010,,,0018-8158,1, English, English,, 121-141,,January 2010,Hydrobiologia, CSAPTjournals,2010," Springer-Verlag, Tiergartenstrasse 17 Heidelberg 69121 Germany",,637,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/phytoplankton-dynamics-relation-connectivity-flow/docview/860388126/se-2?accountid=14505," Hydrobiologia [Hydrobiologia].

Hydrologic and biotic influences on nitrate removal in a subtropical spring-fed river,"We use a long-term chemical and hydrologic record in combination with longitudinal sampling and high-frequency nitrate (NO sub(3) super(-)) measurements from in situ sensors to describe temporal and spatial patterns of nitrogen (N) inputs and removal in the spring-fed Ichetucknee River (Columbia County, Florida) and to determine the hydrological, geomorphic, and biological factors that influence those dynamics. Over a 20-yr period of record, NO sub(3)-N removal averaged 118 kg N d super(-1) (0.77 g N m super(-2) d super(-1)) over the upper 5 km of the Ichetucknee River. Three independent estimates of gross autotrophicNassimilation (from gross primary production, diel NO sub(3) super(-) variation, and standing biomass) agreed closely but accounted for less than 20% of observed N removal. Longitudinal surveys indicate negligible or negative dissolved organic nitrogen and ammonium (NH sub(4) super(+)) production, suggesting that denitrification is the predominant mechanism of N removal in this river. A positive relationship between discharge and the magnitude of NO sub(3)-N removal shows that interactions with the surrounding floodplain exert considerable influence at high flows, and longitudinal NO sub(3) super(-) patterns indicate that N removal may be influenced by channel morphology. These results suggest a greater role for dissimilatory processes and hydrologic connectivity with hyporheic and floodplain sediments than has been previously recognized in highly productive spring-fed rivers of north Florida. While hydrologic variation is the primary determinant of variation in NO sub(3) super(-) removal within the Ichetucknee River, comparison across systems indicates that biotic characteristics can cause significant deviation from predictions based on purely physical models of relationships between river size and N removal.",746163841, 12957464,Scholarly Journals,,"Heffernan, James B;Cohen, Matthew J;Frazer, Thomas K;Thomas, Ray G;Rayfield, Travis J;Gulley, Jason;Martin, Jonathan B;Delfino, Joseph J;Graham, Wendy D",,,," Heffernan, James B",,,,, Journal Article,,,"  0, 2010",,,0024-3590,1, English, English,, 249-263,,"0, 2010",Limnology and Oceanography, CSAPTjournals,2010," American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc., School of Oceanography, WB-10 Seattle WA 98195 USA",,55,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/hydrologic-biotic-influences-on-nitrate-removal/docview/746163841/se-2?accountid=14505," Limnology and Oceanography [Limnol.

The influence of fluctuating ramping rates on the food web of boreal rivers,"A BAC delta (before-after-control-impact) sampling design was applied to determine the possible effects of ramping rate (RR) regulation on food webs structure and function in a regulated boreal river. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures of primary producers, macroinvertebrates and fish to determine variations in the source of carbon fuelling the food web as well as changes in the food web structure under variable RR flow regime. We hypothesized that unrestricted RR would (1) increase the connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic environments allowing for a higher contribution of terrestrial carbon to support the food web and (2) decrease food web length because of frequent disturbances. Unrestricted RR had little influence on 13C values for the overall food web with most of the differences found between impacted sites compared and control sites, indicating that the proportion of various carbon sources entering the diet of consumers remained unchanged under unrestricted RR. In contrast, significantly higher 15N values were measured in impacted sites (invertebrates and fish) and as well as under unrestricted ramping flow regime (invertebrates). Further, unrestricted RR was associated to a significant decrease in the difference between macroinvertebrates and fish 15N signatures, equivalent to a reduction of the length of the food web by at least one trophic level. Results from this study indicate that RR should be taken into consideration in the regulation of operating regimes on rivers.",21066393, 11136223,Scholarly Journals,,"Marty, Jerome;Smokorowski, Karen;Power, Michael",,,," Marty, Jerome",,,, 10.1002/rra.1194, Journal Article,,, October 2009,,,1535-1459,8, English, English,, 962-974,,October 2009,River Research and Applications, CSAPTjournals,2009," Wiley-Blackwell, 111 River Street Hoboken NJ 07030-5774 USA",,25,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/influence-fluctuating-ramping-rates-on-food-web/docview/21066393/se-2?accountid=14505," River Research and Applications [River Res.

Consistent trophic patterns among fishes in lagoon and channel habitats of a tropical floodplain river: Evidence from stable isotopes,"The relationship between food web dynamics and hydrological connectivity in rivers should be strongly influenced by annual flood pulses that affect primary production dynamics and movement of organic matter and consumer taxa. We sampled basal production sources and fishes from connected lagoons and the main channel of a low-gradient, floodplain river within the Orinoco River Basin in Venezuela. Stable isotope analysis was used to model the contribution of four basal production sources to fishes, and to examine patterns of mean trophic position during the falling-water period of the annual flood cycle. IsoSource, a multi-source mixing model, indicated that proportional contributions from production sources to fish assemblages were similar in lagoons and the main channel. Although distributions differed, the means for trophic positions of fish assemblages as well as individual species were similar between the two habitats. These findings contradict recent food web studies conducted in temperate floodplain rivers that described significant differences in trophic positions of fishes from slackwater and floodplain versus main channel habitats. Low between-habitat trophic variation in this tropical river probably results from an extended annual flood pulse (ca. 5 mo.) that allows mixing of sestonic and allochthonous basal production sources and extensive lateral movements of fishes throughout the riverscape.",20869414, 9372781,Scholarly Journals,,"Roach, KA;Winemiller, KO;Layman, CA;Zeug, S C",,,," Roach, KA",,,, 10.1016/j.actao.2009.03.007, Journal Article,,, August 2009,,,1146-609X,4, English, English,, 513-522,,August 2009,Acta Oecologica, CSAPTjournals,2009," Editions Scientifiques et Medicales Elsevier, 23 rue Linois 75724 Paris cedex 15 France",,35,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/consistent-trophic-patterns-among-fishes-lagoon/docview/20869414/se-2?accountid=14505," Acta Oecologica [Acta Oecol.].

Hydrological connectivity drives patterns of macroinvertebrate biodiversity in floodplain rivers of the Australian wet /dry tropics,"1. Floodplain rivers in Australia's wet/dry tropics are regarded as being among the most ecologically intact and bio-diverse lotic ecosystems in the world, yet there have been relatively few community-based studies of their aquatic fauna. 2. To investigate relationships between hydrological connectivity and biodiversity in the region, macroinvertebrates were collected from sites within two contrasting floodplain rivers, the 'tropical' Gregory River and 'dryland' Flinders River systems, during the dry season and analysed at various spatial scales. A subset of sites was re-sampled in the following dry season to explore temporal variation. The fauna consisted of 124 morphotaxa, dominated by gatherers and the Insecta. 3. As predicted, hydrological connectivity (the lotic or lentic status of waterbodies) had a major influence on macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and diversity, both in space and time. Assemblages from waterbodies with similar connection histories were most alike, and beta-diversity between assemblages was greatest between lotic and lentic waterbodies, tending to increase with increasing spatial separation. 4.

Hydrological connectivity drives patterns of macroinvertebrate biodiversity in floodplain rivers of the Australian wet/dry tropics,"Summary1.Floodplain rivers in Australia's wet/dry tropics are regarded as being among the most ecologically intact and bio-diverse lotic ecosystems in the world, yet there have been relatively few community-based studies of their aquatic fauna.2.To investigate relationships between hydrological connectivity and biodiversity in the region, macroinvertebrates were collected from sites within two contrasting floodplain rivers, the 'tropical' Gregory River and 'dryland' Flinders River systems, during the dry season and analysed at various spatial scales. A subset of sites was re-sampled in the following dry season to explore temporal variation. The fauna consisted of 124 morphotaxa, dominated by gatherers and the Insecta.3.As predicted, hydrological connectivity (the lotic or lentic status of waterbodies) had a major influence on macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and diversity, both in space and time. Assemblages from waterbodies with similar connection histories were most alike, and beta-diversity between assemblages was greatest between lotic and lentic waterbodies, tending to increase with increasing spatial separation.4.At smaller spatial scales, a number of within-waterbody, habitat and water quality characteristics were important for explaining variation (61%) in the taxonomic organization of assemblages, and characteristics associated with primary productivity and habitat diversity were important for explaining variation (45%) in the functional organization of assemblages.

Influence of Flood Connectivity on Bottomland Hardwood Forest Productivity in Central Ohio,"Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in response to flooding and other environmental variables was evaluated at a 5.2-ha bottomland hardwood forest along the Olentangy River in central Ohio, USA. The forest is composed of two distinct sections that were hydrologically enhanced in 2001. To approximate natural flooding, the north section was enhanced by cutting three breaches in a more than 70-year-old artificial levee. A fourth breach was cut from a natural riverbank in the south section to connect a lateral swale and augment the existing flood regime. The objective of this study was to evaluate various factors that might affect forest productivity after restoration. In 2004, ANPP for the forest was estimated at 847 plus or minus 50 g m super(-2) yr super(-1) (807 plus or minus 86 g m super(-2) yr super(-1) in the north section and 869 plus or minus 86 g m super(-2) yr super(-1) in the south section). Mean ANPP for the entire forest was similar to an estimate prior to restoration and still below productivity levels reported at other bottomland forests along the Olentnagy River and throughout the Midwest U.S. As part of this study, the influence of flood connectivity and other variables on intra-forest ANPP were also examined. Using daily river-stage data and by monitoring study plots at various flood stages, we estimated the number of days each plot was connected to the river. A significant and positive relationship was detected between plot ANPP and the number of days connected to the river during the 2004 water year (Oct. 2003-Sept. 2004).

"The significance of side-arm connectivity for carbon dynamics of the River Danube, Austria","1. Side-arms connected to the main stem of the river are key areas for biogeochemical cycling in fluvial landscapes, exhibiting high rates of carbon processing. 2. This work focused on quantifying autochthonous and allochthonous carbon pools and, thereby, on comparing transport and transformation processes in a restored side-arm system of the River Danube (Regelsbrunn). We established a carbon budget and quantified carbon processing from March to September 2003. In addition, data from previous studies during 1997 to 1999 were assessed. 3. Gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration were estimated by diel oxygen time curves and an oxygen mass balance. Plankton primary production was determined to estimate its contribution to GPP under different hydrological conditions. 4. Based on the degree of connectivity, three hydrological phases were differentiated. Most of the organic matter, dominated by allochthonous carbon, was transported in the main channel and through the side-arm during floods, while at intermediate and low flows (and thus connectivity), transformation processes became more important and autochthonous carbon dominated the carbon pool. The side-arm system functioned as a sink for particulate matter [total suspended solids and particulate organic carbon (POC)] and a source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chlorophyll-a. 5. Autochthonous primary production of 4.2 t C day¹ in the side-arm was equivalent to about 20% of the allochthonous inputs of 20 t C day¹ (POC and DOC) entering the area at mean flow (1% of the discharge of the main channel). Pelagic photosynthesis was generally high at mean flow (1.3-3.8 g C m² day¹), and contributed up to 90% of system productivity. During long stagnant periods at low discharge, the side-arm was controlled by biological processes and a shift from planktonic to benthic activity occurred (benthic primary production of 0.4-14 g C m² day¹). 6. The transformation of the organic matter that passes through the side-arm under different hydrological conditions, points to the importance of these subsystems in contributing autochthonous carbon to the food web of the main channel.",47516161, IND44002403,Scholarly Journals,,"Preiner, S;Drozdowski, I;Schagerl, M;Schiemer, F;Hein, T",,,," Preiner, S",,,, 10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01888.x, Journal Article,,, Feb 2008,,,0046-5070,2, English, English,, p. 238-252,,Feb 2008,Freshwater biology, CSAPTjournals,2008," Oxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltd"," National Agricultural Library, © Oxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltd",53,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/significance-side-arm-connectivity-carbon/docview/47516161/se-2?accountid=14505," Freshwater biology, 2008 Feb., v. 53, no. 2, p. 238-252, Oxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 0046-5070",,,,,,," Freshwater biology. 2008 Feb., v. 53, no. 2 Oxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Available from publisher's Web site", 238,,," biogeochemical cycles , carbon , carbon sinks , chlorophyll , dissolved organic carbon , floods , food webs , landscapes , oxygen , particulate organic carbon , particulates , photosynthesis , plankton , primary productivity , rivers , total suspended solids , Austria , Danube River , Austria , Danube River"," article , floodplain , primary production , restoration , water age , article",,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=The+significance+of+side-arm+connectivity+for+carbon+dynamics+of+the+River+Danube%2C+Austria&amp;author=Preiner%2C+S%3BDrozdowski%2C+I%3BSchagerl%2C+M%3BSchiemer%2C+F%3BHein%2C+T&amp;volume=53&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=238&amp;date=2008&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Freshwater+biology&amp;issn=0046-5070&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagricolamodule_IND44002403,Natural Science Collection

"Effects Of Hydrologic Connectivity On Water Chemistry, Soils, And Vegetation Structure And Function In An Intermontane Depressional Wetland Landscape","Historically, depressional wetlands have been viewed as small, closed basins without a naturally integrated inter-wetland surface drainage system. In this view, landscape-level connectivity is limited to surface water as overland flow. Contrasting with this view, conceptual prairie pothole ground-water models have relied on ground-water connectivity to explain inter-wetland differences in salinity, duration of inundation, and vegetation structure. To help clarify this contrast, we compared differences in hydrology, ground-water connectivity, near-surface soil moisture, geomorphology, water chemistry, and vegetation community structure and productivity for a suite of depressional wetlands in an intermontane prairie of western Montana. We compared depressional wetlands with and without temporary (< 4 wk) surface-water and/or soil-water connections. Connected wetlands had significantly smaller catchments, but stored more water, stored water longer, and had higher specific conductance than did isolated wetlands. Connected wetlands also had higher net primary productivity and a different plant community composition than did isolated wetlands. Comparisons of study site hydrology, water chemistry, and soil development found strong evidence for no ground-water exchange among any of the wetlands. The absence of ground water connection among these intermontane depressional wetlands emphasizes the importance of temporary surface-water and soil-water connections in depressional wetland ecology, as well as the need to understand the landscape scale variation of dissolved solutes and the distribution, abundance, and productivity of wetland plants among depressional wetlands and across wetland landscapes.",20867134, 8195929,Scholarly Journals,,"Cook, B J;Richard Hauer, F",,,," Cook, B J",,,, 10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[719:EOHCOW]2.0.CO;2, Journal Article,,, September 2007,,,0277-5212,3, English, English,, 719-738,,September 2007,Wetlands, CSAPTjournals,2007," Society of Wetland Scientists, P.O.

Spatial patterns of fish communities along two estuarine gradients in southern Florida,"  Issue Title: Theme: Interaction of Hydrology and Nutrients in Controlling Ecosystem Function in Oligotrophic Coastal Environments of South Florida In tropical and subtropical estuaries, gradients of primary productivity and salinity are generally invoked to explain patterns in community structure and standing crops of fishes. We documented spatial and temporal patterns in fish community structure and standing crops along salinity and nutrient gradients in two subtropical drainages of Everglades National Park, USA. The Shark River drains into the Gulf of Mexico and experiences diurnal tides carrying relatively nutrient enriched waters, while Taylor River is more hydrologically isolated by the oligohaline Florida Bay and experiences no discernable lunar tides. We hypothesized that the more nutrient enriched system would support higher standing crops of fishes in its mangrove zone. We collected 50 species of fish from January 2000 to April 2004 at six sampling sites spanning fresh to brackish salinities in both the Shark and Taylor River drainages. Contrary to expectations, we observed lower standing crops and density of fishes in the more nutrient rich tidal mangrove forest of the Shark River than in the less nutrient rich mangrove habitats bordering the Taylor River. Tidal mangrove habitats in the Shark River were dominated by salt-tolerant fish and displayed lower species richness than mangrove communities in the Taylor River, which included more freshwater taxa and yielded relatively higher richness. These differences were maintained even after controlling for salinity at the time of sampling. Small-scale topographic relief differs between these two systems, possibly created by tidal action in the Shark River. We propose that this difference in topography limits movement of fishes from upstream marshes into the fringing mangrove forest in the Shark River system, but not the Taylor River system. Understanding the influence of habitat structure, including connectivity, on aquatic communities is important to anticipate effects of construction and operational alternatives associated with restoration of the Everglades ecosystem.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",821258614,,Scholarly Journals,,"Green, David P; J;Trexler, Joel C;Lorenz, Jerome J;Mcivor, Carole C;Philippi, Tom",,, Springer 2006,,,,, 10.1007/s10750-006-0144-x, Feature,,, Oct 2006,,,0018-8158,1, English, English,, 387-399, Dordrecht,Oct 2006,Hydrobiologia,,2006,,,569,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/spatial-patterns-fish-communities-along-two/docview/821258614/se-2?accountid=14505,,,,,,,,, 387,,, Salinity,,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Spatial+patterns+of+fish+communities+along+two+estuarine+gradients+in+southern+Florida&amp;author=Green%2C+David+P%3B+J%3BTrexler%2C+Joel+C%3BLorenz%2C+Jerome+J%3BMcivor%2C+Carole+C%3BPhilippi%2C+Tom&amp;volume=569&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=387&amp;date=2006&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Hydrobiologia&amp;issn=0018-8158&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aaqualine_,Natural Science Collection

Evaluating controls on the formation and reservoir architecture of Niagaran Pinnacle Reefs (Silurian) in the Michigan Basin; a sequence stratigraphic approach,"Silurian-aged (Niagaran) ""pinnacle"" reefs have been productive in the Michigan Basin for 60+ years, but extensive lateral and vertical heterogeneity limits primary production to as little as 25%. Enhanced recovery efforts are generally focused on water and CO (sub 2) floods, or horizontal drilling, but the connectivity of the reefs laterally and vertically is poorly understood and unpredictable, leading to marginal success in many reefs. Niagaran ""pinnacle"" reef growth has previously been described as continuous growth during a single relative sea level rise. In this model, the characteristic shoaling upward sequence varies from a microbial mound facies at the base, with a stromatoporoid-dominated reef core capped by algal laminites and anhydrites that form a regional seal for many of the reefs in the Basin. Detailed core analysis within a sequence stratigraphic framework, however, indicates that the overall shoaling sequence is made up of higher frequency depositional cycles, each bounded by exposure or flooding surfaces. These tens of meters to meter scale cycles support an episodic reef growth model controlled by multiple fluctuations in relative sea level, and provides a means to predict reservoir quality since porosity and permeability is often related to primary facies in these reefs. Because many cycles contain reservoir facies bounded by low permeability units, the result is often significant vertical compartmentalization. This core-based understanding of the episodic nature of ""pinnacle"" reef growth, as well as the vertical facies successions and resulting impact on reservoir heterogeneity, should lead to enhanced predictability of reservoir architecture from wireline log signatures alone.",2364109858, 2009-035605,Scholarly Journals, Western Michigan University,"Sandomierski, Anthony;Grammer, G Michael;Harrison, William E;Anonymous", #06983, AAPG 2006 annual convention," GeoRef, Copyright 2020, American Geosciences Institute.

Hydrological control of system characteristics of floodplain lakes,"Water bodies within floodplains are strongly governed by their hydrological connectivity with the main river (Heiler et al. 1995). Connectivity is decisive for the general ecosystem characteristics and the balance between input and output of nutrients and organic carbon sources. A major determinant is the abundance of macrophytic vegetation, which is controlled by through-flow, dry-falling and scouring effects. The autochthonous primary production is strongly augmented by local terrestrial carbon sources and by the riverine transport in form of dissolved and particulate organic matter. The significance of these different sources depends on hydrology. Flood pulses represent a disturbance to pelagic communities (followed by successions) and a source of nutrients. High loads of inorganic nutrients produce conditions for prolific algal growth. High availability of allochthonous organic carbon provides the basis for a prolific bacterial secondary production. Our data emphasize that the stimulus of local aquatic primary production enhances carbon utilization by bacteria.",20726653, 7437522,Scholarly Journals,,"Schiemer, F;Hein, T;Peduzzi, P",,,," Schiemer, F",,,,, Journal Article,,,"  0, 2006",,,1642-3593,1-4, English, English,, 1-18,,"0, 2006",International Journal of Ecohydrology & Hydrobiology, CSAPTjournals,2006,,,6,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/hydrological-control-system-characteristics/docview/20726653/se-2?accountid=14505," International Journal of Ecohydrology & Hydrobiology [Int.

"The impact of surface water exchange on the nutrient and particle dynamics in side-arms along the River Danube, Austria","Results of two monitoring programs obtained in the free-flowing section of the Danube downstream of Vienna were used to evaluate the effects of river restoration designed to increase surface water inputs into side-arms. Functional descriptors like hydrochemical parameters and plankton react immediately to restored hydrological conditions and offer the opportunity to elucidate the hydrological control on organic processing as an important ecosystem function in fluvial landscapes. Two hydraulic parameters were estimated and linked to basic ecological properties. The level of hydrological connectivity was defined as the average annual duration (days per year) of upstream surface connection and can be used as a 'simple to estimate' parameter within the planning phase. Water age, an adapted measure of residence time based on more detailed information, allow description of the temporal development in side-arms. Greater hydrological connectivity leads to lower conductivity levels and increased nutrient concentrations due to the shift of the dominating source to river water. The contribution of river flow is indicated by higher suspended solid concentrations in side-arms than disconnected water bodies. The phytoplankton biomass shows the highest mean values at a duration of integration of 1 month a super(-1) and decrease with increasing connectivity. The relationships point to a more 'main channel like' hydrochemical situation in the side-arms, with a medium level of phytoplankton biomass and increased autochthonous carbon export. No evidence of eutrophication was found due to the shift of the side-arm from an organic matter sink to a source. On a more detailed level, water age demonstrates the temporal patterns of riverine input, the development of plankton production and the shift between hydrological and biological control of phytoplankton vs. riverine flow in a side-arm. The hydrologic parameters were useful predictors for evaluating the effects of restoration measures in river floodplain systems.",19813001, 5938686,Scholarly Journals,,"Hein, T;Baranyi, C;Reckendorfer, W;Schiemer, F",,,," Hein, T",,,, 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2004.01.006, Journal Article,,, July 2004,,,0048-9697,1-3, English, English,, 207-218,,July 2004,Science of the Total Environment, CSAPTjournals,2004," Elsevier Science B.V., P.O.

Landscape ecology: a framework for integrating pattern and process in river corridors,"  Investigations of European floodplain rivers demonstrate how landscape ecology can provide an effective framework to integrate pattern and process in river corridors, to examine environmental dynamics and interactive pathways between landscape elements, and to develop viable strategies for river conservation. The highly complex and dynamic nature of intact river corridors is particularly amenable to a landscape ecology perspective. Analysis of spatial patterns has provided considerable insight into environmental heterogeneity across river corridors and is an essential prelude to examining dynamic interactions. For example, data from aerial photographs, digitized maps and year-round field measurements in a glacial flood plain, enabled us to distinguish six channel types, based on the correspondence between connectivity and physicochemical attributes. Spatial data were also used to analyze longitudinal changes in landscape elements along the course of a morphologically-intact riverine corridor, providing insight into the structural complexity that must have characterized many Alpine rivers in the pristine state. Landscape indices were employed to investigate seasonal dynamics in a glacial flood plain of the Swiss Alps which exhibits a predictable expansion/contraction cycle, with corresponding shifts in flow paths (surface and subsurface) and water sources (snowmelt, englacial, subglacial, alluvial aquifer, hillslope aquifer). Surface connectivity exhibited an unexpected biphasic relationship with total channel length, whereas riverscape diversity progressively increased along the entire range of channel length.

Landscape ecology: a framework for integrating pattern and process in river corridors,"Investigations of European floodplain rivers demonstrate how landscape ecology can provide an effective framework to integrate pattern and process in river corridors, to examine environmental dynamics and interactive pathways between landscape elements, and to develop viable strategies for river conservation. The highly complex and dynamic nature of intact river corridors is particularly amenable to a landscape ecology perspective. Analysis of spatial patterns has provided considerable insight into environmental heterogeneity across river corridors and is an essential prelude to examining dynamic interactions. For example, data from aerial photographs, digitized maps and year-round field measurements in a glacial flood plain, enabled us to distinguish six channel types, based on the correspondence between connectivity and physicochemical attributes. Spatial data were also used to analyze longitudinal changes in landscape elements along the course of a morphologically-intact riverine corridor, providing insight into the structural complexity that must have characterized many Alpine rivers in the pristine state. Landscape indices were employed to investigate seasonal dynamics in a glacial flood plain of the Swiss Alps which exhibits a predictable expansion/contraction cycle, with corresponding shifts in flow paths (surface and subsurface) and water sources (snowmelt, englacial, subglacial, alluvial aquifer, hillslope aquifer). Surface connectivity exhibited an unexpected biphasic relationship with total channel length, whereas riverscape diversity progressively increased along the entire range of channel length. Reconstituting the functional integrity that characterizes intact river corridors should perhaps be the major goal of river conservation initiatives. Although understanding functional processes at the landscape scale is essential in this regard, few data are available. In the Alluvial Zone National Park on the Austrian Danube, three phases of hydrological connectivity were identified (disconnection, seepage connection and surface connection) that corresponded to the predominance of three functional processes (biotic interactions, primary production and particulate transport) within the river corridor.",18569273, 5404541,Scholarly Journals,,"Ward, J V;Malard, F;Tockner, K",,,," Ward, J V",,,,, Journal Article,,, 2002,,,0921-2973,, English, English,, 35-45,,2002,Landscape Ecology, CSAPTjournals,2002,,,17,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/landscape-ecology-framework-integrating-pattern/docview/18569273/se-2?accountid=14505," Landscape Ecology [Landscape Ecol.].

"Hydrological connectivity, and the exchange of organic matter and nutrients in a dynamic river-floodplain system (Danube, Austria)","1. The relationship between hydrological connectivity, and the exchange processes of suspended sediments, organic matter and nutrients (NO sub(3)-N) was investigated in a dynamically connected river-floodplain segment of the Danube over a 15-month period in 1995 and 1996 in the Alluvial Zone National Park, Austria. 2. Based on water level dynamics and water retention times, three phases of river-floodplain connectivity were identified: disconnection (phase I), seepage inflow (phase II) and upstream surface connection (phase III). The frequency of occurrence of these phases was 67.5%, 29.3% and 3.2%, respectively, during the study period. 3. A conceptual model is presented linking hydrological connectivity with ecological processes. Generally, the floodplain shifts from a closed and mainly biologically controlled ecosystem during phase I to an increasingly open and more hydrologically controlled system during phases II and III. Phase I, with internal processes dominating, is designated the 'biotic interaction phase'. 4. Phase II, with massive nutrient inputs to the floodplain yet relatively high residence times, and therefore, high algal biomass, is classified as the 'primary production phase'. This demonstrates that water level fluctuations well below bankfull may considerably enhance floodplain productivity. 5. Finally, since transport of particulate matter is mainly restricted to short flood pulses above bankfull level, phase III has been defined as the 'transport phase'. 6. The floodplain served as a major sink for suspended sediments (250 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)), FPOM (96 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)), particulate organic carbon (POC; 2.9 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)) and nitrate-nitrogen (0.96 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)), but was a source for dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 240 kg ha super(-1) year super(-1)), algal biomass (chlorophyll-a; 0.5 kg ha super(-1) year super(-1)) and CPOM (21 kg ha super(-1) year super(-1)). Considerable quantities of DOC and algal biomass were exported to the river channel during phase II, whereas particulate matter transport was largely restricted to the short floods of phase III. 7. The Danube Restoration Project will create a more gradual change between the individual phases by increasing hydrological connectivity between the river channel and the floodplain, and is predicted to enhance productivity by maintaining a balance between retention and export of nutrients and organic matter.",17380345, 4599478,Scholarly Journals,,"Tockner, K;Pennetzdorfer, D;Reiner, N;Schiemer, F;Ward, J V",,,," Tockner, K",,,, 10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00399.x, Journal Article,,, May 1999,,,0046-5070,3, English, English,, 521-535,,May 1999,Freshwater Biology, CSAPTjournals,1999,,,41,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/hydrological-connectivity-exchange-organic-matter/docview/17380345/se-2?accountid=14505," Freshwater Biology [Freshwat.

"Development, maintenance and role of riparian vegetation in the river landscape","Functional zones were characterised (with respect to vegetation development in association with various biogeochemical processes) within geomorphological settings using a delineation based upon erosional, transitional and depositional properties. Vegetation dynamics within the riparian corridor are clearly influenced substantially by hydrological disturbance regimes. In turn, it is suggested that vegetation productivity and diversity may widely influence riverine biogeochemical processes, especially as related to the consequences of changing redox conditions occurring from upstream to downstream. However, surface and ground linkages are the predominant controls of landscape connectivity within riparian systems. The importance of riparian zones as sources and sinks of matter and energy was examined in context of structural and functional attributes, such as sequestering or cycling of nutrients in sediments, retention of water in vegetation, and retention, diffusion or dispersal of biota. The consequences of interactions between different communities on biogeochemical processes are notably in need of research, especially with respect to control of landscape features.",17330580, 4593150,Scholarly Journals,,"Tabacchi, E;Correll, D L;Hauer, R;Pinay, G;Planty-Tabacchi, A-M;Wissmar, R C",,,," Tabacchi, E",,,,, Journal Article,,,"  0, 1998",,,0046-5070,3, English, English,, 497-516,,"0, 1998",Freshwater Biology, CSAPTjournals,1998,,,40,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/development-maintenance-role-riparian-vegetation/docview/17330580/se-2?accountid=14505," Freshwater Biology.
