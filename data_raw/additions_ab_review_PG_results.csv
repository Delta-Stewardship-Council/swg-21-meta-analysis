hydrologic influence on stream water nitrogen to phosphorus ratios,r3_26,Ag_search_issue,"Watersheds and their complex network of flow paths regulate the movement of water and nutrients to aquatic ecosystems. Overland and subsurface (soil and ground water) flow paths transport nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) with differing levels of efficiency; P transport occurs via surface flow paths almost exclusively and N transport can utilize both overland and subsurface flow paths. Stream water N:P ratios influence ecosystem community composition, nutrient limitation of primary production, and trophic dynamics. Regional patterns of stream water N:P ratios have been identified, however, the controls driving the pattern remains poorly understood. This dissertation hypothesizes that watershed flow paths control the regional variation of stream water N:P ratios. Three independent lines of evidence were pursued to address the hypothesis: (i) a field study that quantified watershed flow paths and stream water N:P ratios in two watersheds with distinctly different hydrology; (ii) a watershed modeling exercise that simulated many different precipitation regimes and recorded the resulting flow paths and N:P ratios; (iii) a data synthesis of 58 minimally-impacted watersheds across the United States that focused on the relationship between stream water N:P ratios and stream discharge. The results from the three studies all indicate that watershed flow paths influence stream water N:P ratios. Furthermore, the results from all lines of evidence identify a possible scaling relationship between N:P ratios and stream discharge across large temporal and spatial ranges. The results suggest that watershed connectivity with the stream, defined as the sum of the active watershed flow paths, is a fundamental condition that helps explain the variability of N:P ratios, and has important implications for the watershed transport of other elements. Such information allows more informed management of aquatic ecosystems in a changing environment.","Green, Mark Benjamin",2007,Agricultural & Environmental Science Collection,pro,PG,n ,stream,y,"N, P",active watershed flow paths,n ,NA,dissertation
the influence of lateral hydrologic connectivity on fluvial flux and ecosystem metabolism in a river-floodplain system,r3_28,Ag_search_issue,"Within mountainous watersheds and river networks, low-gradient valley bottoms can function as locations of high retention and biogeochemical processing. We evaluated hydrologic dynamics, nutrient flux, and aquatic ecosystem metabolism across the snowmelt hydrograph from May – October 2015 along two river segments of the North Saint Vrain Creek, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado: a valley-confined channel (confined segment) and an unconfined wet valley (unconfined segment) directly downstream. We observed significant differences in water, carbon, and nutrient flux, ecosystem metabolism, and lateral hydrologic connectivity dynamics among these contrasting segments. The confined segment was a consistent source of water, carbon, and nutrients and exported 14.4 mm of water, 26 g NO 3 -N ha -1 , 41 g dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) ha -1 , and 721 g dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ha -1 per 100 m of river length over the study period. In contrast, the unconfined segment exhibited variable source-sink dynamics and stored 1.2 g NO 3 -N ha -1 and 1.8 g DON ha -1 , and exported only 1.1 mm of water and 8 g DOC ha -1 per 100 m. The retention of water, DOC and N related to the strength of lateral connectivity between the river and the floodplain, which in turn, influenced fluvial ecosystem metabolism rates. Gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) rates were higher and more variable in the unconfined versus confined river segment; average GPP was +1.01 ± 0.76 g O 2 m -2 d -1 and ER was -1.77 ± 1.10 g O 2 m -2 d -1 in the unconfined segment, whereas average GPP was +0.09 ± 0.14 g O 2 m -2 d -1 and ER was -0.72 ± 0.50 g O 2 m -2 d -1 in the confined segment. We found that along the unconfined segment, metabolism rates generally increased from high to low flows and that the greatest increases occurred in a floodplain side-channel with intermittent surface water connections with the main channel. Combined, our data suggest a conceptual model where DOC and N are delivered to floodplain water-bodies via lateral hydrologic connections during high flows, and are subsequently utilized when velocities decline and processing rates are maximized.","Wegener, Pamela",2016,Agricultural & Environmental Science Collection,pro,PG,n ,river-floodplain,y," nutrient flux, and aquatic ecosystem metabolism",unconfined/confined,n,NA,dissertation
a tracer-based simulation approach to quantify seasonal dynamics of surface-groundwater interactions in the pantanal wetland,r3_02,,"The Pantanal wetland is one of the least explored regions of South America. It is characterized by an outstanding flora and fauna adapted to a seasonal flood pulse controlled by a dry and a wet season within each year. The resulting inundation covers in average an area of approximately 150000km super(2) and is seen as the most important driver for ecological integrity. Evaporation from the large floodplain is supposed to influence the climate of the whole continent. The regional groundwater is connected to the surface water and plays an important role for the characteristic flooding regime by regulating the wetland's water table. The water balance assessment of the wetland and the internal water exchange between surface and groundwater is therefore of high relevance for the conservation of the Pantanal biodiversity. Despite of its importance, water balance studies including groundwater-surface water interactions based on field data are rarely undertaken. This is mainly due to the remoteness and difficulty in accessing this area, which results in lack of data. In our study, we developed a new tracer-based model to simulate the spatio-temporal surface and subsurface fluxes for a range of water bodies. The model was able to simulate these fluxes considering a dynamic simulation of inflow and outflow using a newly collected 2-year dataset of water levels, stable water isotopes and chloride collected from several water bodies in the northern Pantanal region. Quantitative differences between water bodies according to their location in the floodplain were determined by the flooding regime and connectivity as well as site-specific characteristics, such as hydraulic conductivity and water depth. Our model simulated water balance fluxes with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.61, whereas it simulated stable water isotopic compositions better than chloride. We present the first study based on field data for the Pantanal, which is able to quantify water balances fluxes. Because their representation in global climate and land cover products is insufficient, our simulation results are valuable for validating large-scale models.","Schwerdtfeger, J;Hartmann, A;Weiler, M",2016,ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts,chla,PG,n,floodplain,y,stable water isotopes and chloride,water balances fluxes,y,NA,NA
changes in water chemistry associated with beaver-impounded coastal marshes of eastern georgian bay,r3_04,,"Coastal marshes of eastern Georgian Bay contain unique water chemistry that reflects mixing between the relatively ion-rich waters of Georgian Bay and the relatively ion-poor water draining the Canadian Shield landscape. These unique chemical characteristics may be dramatically altered when wetlands become hydrologically disconnected from Georgian Bay through beaver activity. We sampled 35 coastal marshes in Georgian Bay, 17 of which had beaver impoundments built at the outlet of the coastal wetland. Impounded marshes had significantly higher total phosphorus (30.2 versus 15.3 mu g.L super(-1), p = 0.0015), soluble reactive phosphorus, (13.33 versus 3.7 mu g.L super(-1), p less than or equal to 0.0001), total suspended solids (15.5 versus 2.1 mg.L super(-1), p less than or equal to 0.0001), turbidity (5.4 versus 1.6, p = 0.0004), and chlorophyll (6.2 versus 1.9 mu g.L super(-1), p = 0.0004), but significantly lower pH (5.57 versus 6.95, p less than or equal to 0.0001), nitrates (0.03 versus 0.04 mg.L super(-1), p = 0.0416), and conductivity (47 versus 134 mu S.cm super(-1), p less than or equal to 0.0001), indicative of reduced mixing with Georgian Bay. The mosaic of chemical conditions and altered hydrological connectivity associated with beaver impoundments in coastal marshes of Georgian Bay may affect the distribution of other wetland biota, and further studies should be conducted to ascertain these impacts.","Fracz, Amanda;Chow-Fraser, Patricia",2013,ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts,chla,PG,y,coastal marshes,y,"P, suspended solids, turbidity, chl",beaver impoundments,n,NA,marine
"development of a high-resolution land cover product of the rocky mountains with application to carbon concentrations in its streams; assessing anthropogenic, climatological, and morphological contributions",r3_06,,"In recent decades, the Rocky Mountain (RM) region has undergone significant changes associated with anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization and forest logging for agriculture, and natural disturbances, such as wildfires and bark beetle infestations. These changes have the potential to alter primary productivity and biomass carbon storage. Specifically, changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the RM streams are relevant because dissolved organic matter affects heterotrophic processes, acts as a source for the nutrient cycle, absorbs sunlight radiation, alters the transport of metals, and can promote the appearance of carcinogenic byproducts during water treatment. Specifically, recent studies have focused on the relationship between bark beetle infestations and stream organic matter, but have reached conflicting conclusions, possibly due to the small areas analyzed or an incomplete understanding of the processes that influence organic matter concentrations. Consequently, here we compile and process multiple datasets representing changes and features of the RM region for the period 1983-2012 with the purpose of assessing their relative influence on stream DOC concentrations. Land cover (LC) is especially important for modeling DOC. LC drives many environmental processes, so its assessment, monitoring, and characterization are essential. However, existing LC products each have different temporal and spatial resolutions and different LC classes and cannot be used for our goal of studying the large scale spatial-temporal variability of DOC. Here, we review the complexities of LC identification and propose a method for fusing multiple existing LC products to produce a single LC record for a large spatial-temporal grid, referred to as spatiotemporal categorical map fusion (SCaMF). We first reconcile the LC classes of different LC products and then present a probabilistic weighted nearest neighbor estimator of LC class. This estimator depends on three unknown parameters that are estimated using numerical optimization to maximize a user-defined agreement criterion. We illustrate the method using six LC products over the Rocky Mountains and show the improvement gained by supplying the optimization with data-driven information describing the spatial-temporal behavior of each LC class. Given the massive size of the LC products, we show how the optimal parameters for a given year are often optimal for other years, leading to shorter computing times. We implement the SCaMF methodology over a large region of the RM, encompassing sections of six states, to create a new LC product, SCaMF-RM. To do this, we adapt SCaMF to address the prediction of LC in large space-time regions that present nonstationarities, and we add more flexibility in the LC classifications of the predicted product. SCaMF-RM is produced at two high spatial resolutions, 30 and 50 m, and a yearly frequency for the 30-year period 1983-2012. When multiple products are available in time, we illustrate how SCaMF-RM captures relevant information from the different LC products and improves upon flaws in other products. Future work needed includes an exhaustive validation not only of SCaMF-RM but also of all input LC products. The features of the RM region for the period 1983-2012 representing possible influences on stream DOC concentrations are grouped in four categories: anthropogenic activities, forest disturbances, climate change, and the region's morphology, including LC. We analyze the significance of each of these features when predicting base-flow DOC concentrations in the RM streams, because base-flow concentrations are more representative of the longer-term (annual to decadal) impacts. To do this, we use a statistical model to account for the possible correlation among features and for the intrinsic connectivity and hydrologic directionality of a stream network. While natural forest disturbances are positively correlated with increased DOC concentrations, the effect of urbanization is far greater. Similarly, higher maximum temperatures, which can be exacerbated by climate change, are also associated with elevated DOC concentrations. Overall, DOC concentrations present an increasing trend over time in the RM region.","Rodriguez Jeangros, Nicolas",2018,GeoRef,pro,PG,n,stream,y,dissolved organic carbon, intrinsic connectivity and hydrologic directionality of a stream network,n,NA,dissertation
"hydrodynamic investigation of surface hydrological connectivity and its effects on the water quality of seasonal lakes: insights from a complex floodplain setting (poyang lake, china)",r3_08,,"Small, seasonal lakes that exist in floodplains are rarely investigated, and yet they play an important role in the protection of biodiversity and are highly susceptible to modification due to human activities. This study presents a first attempt to combine hydrodynamic modeling and statistical methods to investigate hydrological connectivity and its relationship with the water quality of nine seasonal lakes within the floodplains of Poyang Lake (China). The hydrodynamic model reproduced reasonably well the hydrological regime of the lake and surrounding floodplains, based on field measurements and remote sensing data. Floodplain lakes exhibit similar water-level dynamics to the main lake during connected periods of flooding, while they decouple from the main lake during recession periods. Geostatistical results reveal that although the north-south hydrological connectivity extends over a longer pathway than the west-east connectivity, the rapid reduction in the west-east connectivity indicates a more sensitive response. The west-east connectivity tends to play a dominant role in affecting the interactions between the main lake and floodplains, as expected. Statistical methods indicate that surface hydrological connectivity across the floodplain results in an enhanced spatial similarity in the water quality of the floodplain lakes, in terms of a multitude of water quality parameters (TN, TP, NH4+-N, NO3−-N, NO2−-N, PO43−, CODMn, and Chl a), while surface hydrological isolation was observed to increase the water quality differences between the seasonal lakes. Additionally, enhanced hydrological connectivity may lead to improved water quality of the seasonal lakes from low connectivity to high connectivity condition. Hydrological connectivity may be a key factor controlling the dynamics in water quality between seasonal lakes. The findings of this study support the management of both Poyang Lake and the floodplain wetlands by providing important information on both water resource and water quality, and proposals to better manage the impacts of intensive human activities.","Li, Yunliang;Wu, Huawu;Yao, Jing;Zhang, Qi;Liu, Xinggen;Cai, Yongjiu;Tan, Zhiqiang",2019,Agricultural & Environmental Science Collection,chla,PG,n,"small, seasonal lakes that exist in floodplains",y,"TN, TP, NH4+-N, NO3−-N, NO2−-N, PO43−, CODMn, and Chl a",surface hydrology,y,NA,NA
investigation of discharge-area groundwaters for recharge source characterization on different scales: the case of jinan in northern china,r3_10,,"Discharge-area groundwater in Jinan, a typical karst region in northern China, was investigated by studying both the hydrological and chemical processes evolving from the recharge in mountainous terrains to the karst-spring outflows in the metropolitan area. Large-scale exploitation of karst groundwater has led to a disturbing trend in the ever-decreasing spring outflow rates and groundwater level. There is insufficient information about the Jinan karst aquifers, which provide the main water sources to meet human demand and to sustain spring outflow. The coupling of hydrological and chemical processes quantifies the flow system through aqueous chemistry characterization of the water sources. This approach is used to study the groundwater flow discharges in different locations and geological settings. The potentiometric data indicated limited vertical connectivity between distinct hydrogeological units and alteration of the recharge regime by the faults and by artificial exploitation. Shallow groundwater primarily belongs to the local flow system, with high nitrate concentration and enriched stable isotopic contents. Thermal groundwater has high concentrations of chloride and total dissolved solids, derived from a regional flow system with the highest recharge altitudes and long residence time. Non-thermal karst water may be attributed to the intermediate flow system, with uniform HCO sub(3)-Ca(Mg) facies and low nitrate concentration. This work highlighted discharge as a fingerprint of groundwater flow conditions and provides a better insight into the hydrogeological system.","Wang, Jiale;Jin, Menggui;Lu, Guoping;Zhang, Dele;Kang, Fengxin;Jia, Baojie",2016,ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts,chla,PG,n,groundwater,y,HCO sub(3)-Ca(Mg),vertical connectivity between distinct hydrogeological units,y,NA,NA
nutrient controls on phytoplankton composition and ecological function among hydrologically distinct habitats in the upper mississippi river ,r3_12,,"The Upper Mississippi River (UMR) is a productive floodplain river with a complex lateral habitat array. Three habitats (main channel, flow-through backwater (moderately connected), and single-connection backwater (least connected)) in a typical UMR reach (Pool 8 near La Crosse, WI) representing a connectivity gradient (distance to main channel) were studied. Differential responses by species of phytoplankton to diverse habitat conditions promoted compositional differences among contrasting habitats. Increases in cyanobacterial blooms have raised awareness that nutrient factors may be important to UMR phytoplankton dynamics. Four main goals of my research were to identify: (1) present (1999-2004) spatiotemporal patterns in phytoplankton species composition and related nutrient regimes in UMR Pool 8, (2) which nutrients control algal production across habitat and phytoplankton assemblage type, (3) the effect of nutrient enrichment on phytoplankton composition, and (4) how nutrient enrichment affects the ecological function (N sub(2)-fixation) of bloom-forming cyanobacteria. Nutrient addition bioassays were conducted in situ to test effects of nutrient enrichment on phytoplankton. Multivariate analyses aided in the identification of multi-species differences over space and time. Results indicated that seasonal change and to a lesser extent habitat differences affected phytoplankton species composition and that phosphorus (P) was the nutrient that best explained compositional patterns. Bioassay experiments indicated that net phytoplankton production was often N-limited or co-limited by N and P but that P alone was important in the single-connection backwater. The flow-through backwater was limited most frequently and had the greatest degree of limitation overall. In general, the strongest responses to nutrient enrichment by UMR phytoplankton occurred in response to NP-enrichment and resulted in greater species diversity. Often the addition of N alone or in combination with P resulted in lower cell densities and/or relative abundance of N sub(2)-fixing cyanobacteria, while non-N sub(2)-fixing cyanobacteria and chlorophytes responded positively to N and NP enrichment. Iron was found to be a factor determining cyanobacterial species composition. N sub(2)-fixation was found to supplement cyanobacterial N-requirements in single-connection and main channel habitats and was controlled by P supply. Management programs are going to need to account for the complex spatiotemporal dynamics between phytoplankton and nutrient supply identified in this study.","Decker, Jillian Kate",2012,ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts,chla,PG,n,river-floodplain,y,"phytoplankton, N, P","habitats (main channel, flow-through backwater (moderately connected), and single-connection backwater (least connected))",n,NA,dissertation
"phytoplankton assemblages in a reservoir cascade of a large tropical - subtropical river (se, brazil)",r3_14,,"The phytoplankton assemblages from eight reservoirs of the Paranapanema River were studied during two consecutive years. Chlorophyceae and Bacillaryophyceae dominated in richness. The observed high number of taxa, 234, reflects the extensive sampling programme and evidences the necessity of considering the whole hydrograph basin to assess the biodiversity status of inland water ecosystems. The dams had a negative effect on phytoplankton richness, with higher number of taxa associate to riverine (non-regulated) stretches. The tributary rivers also exhibited high species richness, showing the importance of considering the lateral dimension, in addition to the longitudinal one, for aquatic biota inventories in large river basins/reservoirs. Richness and diversity were also positively influenced by the connectivity with lateral wetlands (macrophyte-dominated lakes) due to the periphyton influence. The phytoplankton abundance/biomass was not influenced by higher water retention time. Higher values occurred in the middle basin stretches (river-passage reservoirs) due to the increase in the trophic conditions. There was a positive correlation with phosphorus. Poorer light conditions in the cascade do not limit the phytoplankton biomass, with assemblages dominated by species tolerant to turbulent conditions and high mineral turbidity. Bacillariophyceae and Cryptophyceae dominated numerically. The first group (unicellular forms) was prominent in the large and oligotrophic upstream reservoirs. The second was highly abundant in the river-passage (low retention time), and more eutrophic, reservoirs. Cyanophyceae growth is probably controlled by advection processes (wash-out effect). The zooplankton does not control the phytoplankton biomass and the diversity of both groups is positively associated in the cascade. The structure of the phytoplankton assemblages showed to be a good indicator of the operationally distinct reservoirs of the Paranapanema cascade and also reflected the changes in the trophic conditions along the basin.","Nogueira, M G;Ferrareze, M;Moreira, M L;Gouvea, R M",2010,ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts,chla,PG,n,reservoir,y,phytoplankton assemblages,dam,y,NA,NA
phytoplankton of the middle parana river during an anomalous hydrological period: a morphological and functional approach,r3_16,,"The Parana River mainstem was sampled monthly (November 1999-December 2000) in order to analyse phytoplankton structure and dynamics during a period of extreme low water discharge. Physiognomic groups, size fractions, taxonomic groups, species and Reynolds et al. [2002, Journal of Plankton Research, 24: 417-428] functional groups were studied in relation to environmental variables. The phytoplankton comprised an unusual development of small unicellular flagellates (1-20 mm), whereas large size algae such as the commonly recorded Aulacoseira were present with very low abundances. Groups Y (Cryptomonas spp.), X2 (Chlamydomonas spp., Rhodomonas minuta followed by a silicean chrysophyte) and D (Skeletonema cf. subsalsum and small centrics in minor proportion) dominated the phytoplankton community. Groups X2 and Y dominated at drought phase (November-December 1999). During the coupling of increasing waters and high-suspended solids (February-May 2000) minimum abundance was exhibited. The highest densities were registered during mid-waters (Y, D, X2) when a constant river-floodplain feedback occurred (September-December). The connectivity between the main channel and its alluvial valley, and their interaction resulting from the regular alternation of hydrological fluctuations, play a steering role in structuring the potamoplankton of large rivers. The multivariate RDA showed that water discharge and transparency highly explained a significant proportion of the functional groups variation. The functional classification is proposed as a useful approach in reconstructing the phytoplankton community. The differences in structure from the typically described potamoplankton for the Parana were maintained throughout the study period. The perseverance of the community changes that occurred during the drought depends, in part, on the persistence and magnitude of this anomalous phase.","Devercelli, Melina",2006,ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts,chla,PG,n,river ,y,phytoplankton,water level,y,NA,NA
spatial and temporal dynamics of suspended particle characteristics and composition in navigation pool 19 of the upper mississippi river,r3_18,,"Suspended particles are an essential component of large rivers influencing channel geomorphology, biogeochemical cycling of nutrients, and food web resources. The Upper Mississippi River is a large floodplain river that exhibits pronounced spatiotemporal variation in environmental conditions and biota, providing an ideal environment for investigating dynamics of suspended particles in large river ecosystems. Here we investigated two questions: (i) How do suspended particle characteristics (e.g. size and morphology) vary temporally and spatially? and (ii) What environmental variables have the strongest association with particle characteristics? Water sampling was conducted in June, August, and September of 2013 and 2014 in Navigation Pool 19 of the Upper Mississippi River. A FlowCAM® (Flow Cytometer and Microscope) particle imaging system was used to enumerate and measure particles 53-300 µm in diameter for size and shape characteristics (e.g. volume, elongation, and symmetry). Suspended particle characteristics varied considerably over space and time and were strongly associated with discharge and concentrations of nitrate + nitrite (NO(3) ) and soluble reactive phosphorus. Particle characteristics in backwaters were distinct from those in other habitats for most of the study period, likely due to reduced hydrologic connectivity and higher biotic production in backwaters. During low discharge, phytoplankton and zooplankton made up relatively greater proportions of the observed particles. Concurrently during low discharge, concentrations of chlorophyll, volatile suspended solids, and total phosphorus were higher. Our results suggest that there are complex interactions among space, time, discharge, and other environmental variables (e.g. water nutrients), which drive suspended particle dynamics in large rivers.

"the main target of connection of lakes with rivers is not to dilute pollutants, but to rehabilitate natural hydrological regimes and self-purification function",r3_20,,"Water diversion from rivers to lakes is popularly considered as a measure to control lake eutrophication, but the actual efficacy is quite limited in general. How to connect lakes with rivers in a scientific way? To answer this question, first, I analyze 5 diversion cases in China and other countries, and simulate effect of adding water using Vollen-weider's model. The results show that improving water quality by dilution depends upon whether there is large amount of input water with total phosphorus concentrations much lower than original inflow ones, but such a premise is generally difficult to meet. Second, I compare water quality of lakes disconnected and connected with the Yangtze mainstem, and find that chlorophyl a concentration of water in disconnected lakes are increased by 0.7-2.4 times when total phosphorus concentrations are in the same levels. The mechanisms of better water quality of connected lakes are fourfold, i.e., the natural water level fluctuation promotes vegetation development, seasonal trying-up and shallowing of lakeshore promotes pollutants decomposition and adsorption, turbid flowing water results in lower efficiency of nutrient utilization by phytoplankton, and the ecological complexity is higher with more heterogeneous habitats, higher biodiversity, and more complex food webs. Last, I point out that setting a scientific feasible target is the very basis to implement a river-lake connection project correctly. If the aim is to dilute pollutants, enough clean water is needed, and this can only be realized for smaller waterbodies. If the aim is to wash out phytoplankton, the flushing rate should be higher than specific growth rates of dominated algae, reaching 10%-20%/d, and this is also only feasible for smaller waterbodies. As for most lakes, in particular, shallow ones, connection of lakes with rivers should aim mainly to rehabilitate free hydrological connectivity and natural water level regimes, and then to enhance self-purification function. Such a mode costs a lesser amount of water, but reaches the best effect.

trophic gradients in a large-river delta: ecological structure determined by connectivity gradients in the danube delta (romania),r3_22,,"There are over 300 lakes interconnected by riverbranches and man-made canals in the Danube Delta (Romania). A multidisciplinary survey of these riverine lakes situated in large wetland complexes was made comprising hydrological modelling, remote sensing and monitoring of water quality, plankton, aquatic vegetation and fish communities. Between-lake differences in water quality and aquatic vegetation cover were inferred from satellite image. Based on channel and lake dimensions, hydrological characteristics of the lakes in the delta were determined: hydrological distance from a riverbranch, residence time and impact of reed water. Water-quality and biotic parameters (phyto- and zooplankton, submerged plants and fish) were sampled in a comparative survey in June 1997-1999 in subsets of the lakes. In a follow-up study in 2001-2002, seasonality of aquatic vegetation and fish were recorded. A clear distinction was found in three lake types: (1) inflow lakes at short distance to the river, with a high flushing rate, high load of suspended minerals but low chlorophyll concentrations, high cover of floating and submerged vegetation and dominance of eurytopic fish; (2) large, relatively deep lakes with moderately long residence time, high Potamogeton-cover that collapses during summer, and dominated by eurytopic fish; (3) smaller, isolated lakes at the longest distance from the river, with long residence time, of which the water quality is strongly influenced by water flows through large floating reedbeds (blackwater), with a high vegetation cover of Ceratophyllum demersum and Nitellopsis obtusa throughout the summer and a limnophilic fish community tolerant for low oxygen conditions. Aquatic vegetation showed a clear seasonality related to the interaction between plant development and light conditions. Seasonal changes in fish distribution within the system merely followed the vegetation trends in different lakes and the conditions in the river channels. Past trends in the trophic gradient are discussed in the context of hydromorphological modifications in the Delta.

"water quality and ecology of lake kanyaboli, kenya: current status and historical changes",r3_24,,"Small waterbodies are the most threatened freshwater habitats because of the large ratio between their size and the catchment they drain. The present study assessed the current and historical changes in the physical, chemical and biological variables of Lake Kanyaboli, a satellite lake on the northern shores of Lake Victoria in western Kenya. Primary and secondary data on pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, temperature, Secchi depth (SD), and nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations were utilized in the present study. The results indicated Secchi depth and chlorophyll-a were the most erratic of all the analyzed environmental variables studied, exhibiting a range of 0.69 +/- 0.29-0.87 +/- 0.34 m and 9.03 +/- 0.81-34.97 +/- 3.36 mu g/L respectively. Two-way ANOVA yielded no significant interactions between sampling sites and seasons for all the variables. Except chlorophyll-a, there also were no significant differences among the sampling sites for the studied variables. Seasonality yielded significant differences for Secchi depth, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a. The Carlson Trophic Index for Chl-a and SD indicated Lake Kanyaboli is currently eutrophic, while the TP concentration indicated hypereutrophic conditions. The lake, however, has fluctuated between eutrophic and hypereutrophic conditions over the past years. Although historical water quality data for the lake is scanty and infrequent, most physical and chemical variables reflected anthropogenic effects on a temporal scale. Interestingly, despite its eutrophic status, the general lake condition is still relatively good, attributable to the buffering effect from the extensive macrophytes fringing it. The present study identified nutrient loading, wetland reclamation and connectivity with the Yala River through a feeder canal as the management issues of critical concern. Accordingly continuous monitoring of the lake's water quality to detect anthropogenic effects is recommended for management intervention purposes.","Kondowe, Benjamin N.; Masese, Frank O.; Raburu, Philip O.; Singini, Wales; Walumona, Riziki Jacques",2022,BiosisPreview,chla,PG,n,lake,y,"primary and secondary data on pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, temperature, Secchi depth (SD), and nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations",unclear,y,NA,NA
