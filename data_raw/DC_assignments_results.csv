1,temporal coherence between lake and landscape primary productivity,"Understanding the patterns and drivers of primary productivity is a major goal of ecology, but little is known about whether the primary productivities of different types of ecosystems—here, lakes and the landscapes in which they are embedded—fluctuate in related ways through time. Due to shared climatic variation and well-known connections between lake and terrestrial ecosystems, such as nutrient and resource subsidies, we hypothesized that interannual fluctuations in aquatic and terrestrial primary productivity indices could be coherent. We also expected that lake and watershed characteristics could modify the strength and nature of primary productivity relationships. We applied wavelet coherence analyses to time series of lake chlorophyll-a and satellite-derived NDVI to examine coherence between lakes and land, and used random forest regression and generalized additive models to evaluate why coherence varies among lakes. There can be substantial coherence between lake and terrestrial primary productivity, but the strength and phase (direction and time lag) of this relationship vary widely, and there were marked differences between short (2–4-year periods of oscillation) and long (&gt; 4-year periods of oscillation) timescales. Across all timescales, variables associated with the connectedness of lakes to their watersheds were consistently the important explanatory variables of the strength and phase of coherence. The patterns observed in this study suggest the importance of cross-ecosystem flows, as opposed to shared climatic variation, in determining temporal coherence between lakes and the landscape.","Walter, Jonathan A;Fleck, Rachel;Kastens, Jude H;Pace, Michael L;Wilkinson, Grace M",Scholarly Journals,2021,24,2517102093,proquest,DC,ES,n,lake,y,chlorophyll-a and NDVI,adjacency (somewhat unclear),y,"The connectivity metrics are not well defined, they are statistically derived from the landscapes surrounding the lakes"
2,"suspended sediment, nutrients, and chlorophyll in tropical floodplain lakes with different patterns of hydrological connectivity","The ecological functioning of floodplain lakes is largely influenced by the interaction with the river mainstem. In this study, seasonal variation in water chemistry and the relationship with the river conditions were compared between floodplain lakes that differ in the level of connection to the Usumacinta River, the largest river of Mesoamerica. Samples for suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll a were collected through the year in lakes permanently connected to the river and in lakes that only received water from the Usumacinta for a short period during peak flow. Floodplain lakes showed higher total suspended solids than the river during the dry season while during the rainy season greater differences were observed between the river and the lakes, probably explained by higher concentrations in the river and greater sedimentation in the lakes. Greater organic matter content in the suspended solids was observed in the floodplain lakes, particularly in the more isolated lakes, likely related to high algal biomass. Nitrate concentrations were always higher in the river than in the lakes and lower nitrate concentrations occurred at the isolated lakes, suggesting that processes that remove nitrate occur through the year and are a common feature of floodplain lakes. Phosphorus in the connected lakes was higher than in the river only during the dry season, while in the isolated lakes concentrations were always greater than in the river. Chlorophyll a concentrations were higher in the connected lakes than in the river only during the dry season, while the more isolated lakes exhibited higher values through the year, showing signs of eutrophication. Suspended organic matter, nitrate, and chlorophyll showed larger differences between lake and river sites in the more isolated lakes, probably related to greater water residence time and its influence on primary production. Less connected lakes are more vulnerable to flow alteration because the brief period of connection to the river can be compromised and the effects of eutrophication exacerbated.","Castillo, María M",Scholarly Journals,2020,82,2439434677,proquest,DC,PG,n,lake and river,y,"chlorophyll-a, nitrite, organic matter, phosporus",spatial isolation/connection,y,NA
3,phytoplankton dynamics in the congo river,"We report a dataset of phytoplankton in the Congo River, acquired along a 1700-km stretch in the mainstem during high water (HW, December 2013) and falling water (FW, June 2014). Samples for phytoplankton analysis were collected in the main river, in tributaries and one lake, and various relevant environmental variables were measured. Phytoplankton biomass and composition were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and marker pigments and by microscopy. Primary production measurements were made using the ¹³C incubation technique. In addition, data are also reported from a 19-month regular sampling (bi-monthly) at a fixed station in the mainstem of the upper Congo (at the city of Kisangani). Chl a concentrations differed between the two periods studied: in the mainstem, they varied between 0.07 and 1.77 µg L¹ in HW conditions and between 1.13 and 7.68 µg L¹ in FW conditions. The relative contribution to phytoplankton biomass from tributaries (mostly black waters) and from a few permanent lakes was low, and the main confluences resulted in phytoplankton dilution. Based on marker pigment concentration, green algae (both chlorophytes and streptophytes) dominated in the mainstem in HW, whereas diatoms dominated in FW; cryptophytes and cyanobacteria were more abundant but still relatively low in the FW period, both in the tributaries and in the main channel. Daily integrated production measured in the mainstem (n = 15) varied between 64.3 and 434.1 mg C m² day¹ in FW conditions and between 51.5 and 247.6 mg C m² day¹ in HW. Phytoplankton biomass in the Congo River mainstem was likely constrained by hydrological factors (accumulation due to increased retention time during FW, dilution by increased discharge during HW), even though increased nutrient availability in the FW period might have also stimulated phytoplankton production. In contrast to other tropical river systems where connectivity with the floodplain and the presence of natural lakes and man-made reservoirs play a prominent role in the recruitment of phytoplankton to the main river, our results show that phytoplankton growth in the Congo River can take place in the main channel, with hydrological processes allowing maintenance of phytoplankton biomass even during HW.","Descy, Jean-Pierre;Darchambeau, François;Lambert, Thibault;Stoyneva-Gaertner, Maya P;Bouillon, Steven;Borges, Alberto V",Scholarly Journals,2017,62,2000461867,proquest,DC,CP,n,lake and river,y,chlorophyll-a,proximity to main-stem river,y,NA
4,hydrological connectivity as most probable key driver of chlorophyll and nutrients in oxbow lakes of the bug river (poland),"Concentrations of chlorophyll, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, total phosphorus and suspended solids were analysed in 10 oxbow lakes of the Bug River in spring and summer. According to their connectivity with the river, all lakes were divided into 3 categories – lakes connected with the river channel but separated from the floodplain inputs, lakes connected with the river but receiving inputs from the floodplain and totally isolated lakes. Connected lakes showed significantly higher concentrations of available nutrients and chlorophyll but the relationship between the two variables was weak in the spring and non-existent in the summer. Suspended solids were also more abundant in connected than in isolated lakes. Analyses of the proportion of chlorophyll and particulate phosphorus in suspension led us to the conclusion that water movement in connected lakes inhibited sedimentation and kept algae in the water column. Isolated oxbow lakes devoid of wind-driven mixing were more susceptible to algal sedimentation which would explain the differences observed between the two lake categories.","Kufel, Lech;Szymon Leśniczuk",Scholarly Journals,2014,46,2000146923,proquest,DC,MB,n,lake,y,chlorophyll and nutrients,connectivity to river,y,NA
5,"serial discontinuity along the descoberto river basin, central brazil","Aim: The Descoberto Basin was studied as a discontinuous ecological system through one seasonal cycle (about one year), at 13 sampling sites; Methods: The connectivity was analyzed in relation to environmental and limnological characteristics along the length of the Descoberto River, and the variables that most influenced the different sampling sites were determined; Results: Sites K and L, located upstream and downstream of the entrance of the Melchior River, respectively, differed most in physical and chemical parameters. A Principal Components Analysis demonstrated that the system was more influenced spatially than temporally, with 74.57% of accumulated variance accounted for by the first two axes. High values of chloride, chlorophyll-a, BOD5, total phosphorus, and total organic carbon, as well as low dissolved-oxygen concentrations separated sites L and M from the others. Winter and spring were the seasons in which most parameters showed significant differences among the sites; Conclusions: The construction of the dam and waste discharge act as discontinuity factors affecting the referred system, mainly at middle region and lower patch, between the sites K and L. Besides the construction of the reservoir, the Melchior River, an extremely impacted system, affects the Descoberto River downstream from its entry. Important changes in water quality occur in the lower basin, especially downstream of the Descoberto Reservoir, with significant increases in nutrient concentrations, suspended solids, turbidity, and chlorophyll a, and therefore a decrease in water clarity.Original Abstract: Objetivo: A bacia do rio Descoberto foi estudada como um sistema descontinuo atraves de um ciclo sazonal (um ano) em 13 estacoes amostrais; Metodos: A conectividade foi analisada em relacao a caracteristicas ambientais e limnologicas ao longo eixo longitudinal do rio Descoberto e as variaveis que mais influenciaram as diferentes estacoes amostrais foram determinadas; Resultados: As estacoes K e L, localizadas a montante e jusante da entrada do rio Melchior, respectivamente, diferiram mais quanto aos parametros fisicos e qulmicos da agua. Uma analise de componentes principals (PCA) demonstrou que o sistema foi mais influenciado espacialmente que temporalmente, com 74,57% da variancia total acumulada nos dois primeiros eixos. Altos valores de cloreto, clorofila a, DBO5, fosforo total e carbono organico total, tanto quanto baixas concentracoes de oxigenio dissolvido separaram as estacoes L e M das demais. Inverno e primavera foram estacoes nas quais a maioria dos parametros apresentou diferencas significativas entre as estacoes; Conclusoes: A construcao do reservatorio e descargas de esgoto atuaram como fatores de descontinuidade afetando o referido sistema, principalmente no trecho medio do rio e no trecho inferior, entre estacoes K e L. O rio Melchior, a partir de sua entrada, afetou o rio Descoberto. Importantes mudancas na qualidade de agua ocorreram na bacia especialmente a jusante do reservatorio, com aumentos significativos de nutrientes, solidos suspensos, turbidez e clorofila a e, portanto, na diminuicao da transparencia da agua.","da Silva, WJ;Felisberto, SA;Fonseca, C P;das Gracas Machado de Souza, M",Scholarly Journals,2010,22,869576543,proquest,DC,CP,n,river,y,"chlorophyll-a, BOD5, phosphorus, organic carbon, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, suspended solids",distance along river,y,also includes a temporal metric
6,floods increase similarity among aquatic habitats in river-floodplain systems,"During low water levels, habitats in river-floodplain systems are isolated from each other and from the main river. Oppositely, floods tend to connect water bodies with distinct hydrological characteristics and, as a result, ecological processes and biological communities tend to be more similar among the distinct habitats that comprise a river-floodplain system. Based on a literature review and also using unpublished data obtained in tropical floodplains, the aim of this paper is to highlight the effects of floods as a process that reduce spatial variability. The usual negative relationship between the coefficient of variation of any ecological indicator (e.g., chlorophyll-a or total phosphorus) and water level is the main result demonstrating a reduction in spatial variability due to floods. Considering physical, chemical or biotic data gathered in distinct habitats within the floodplain, this pattern was found in temperate and tropical regions, subjected to distinct levels of anthropogenic impacts, and at different spatial extents. The main mechanism that accounts for this pattern may be stated as follow. During low water level, the biological communities of each habitat in the floodplain (e.g. lagoons, backwater, streams) follow distinct temporal trajectories due to the effects of local driving forces (e.g. an efficient predator trapped in a lagoon but not in another). Management plans and biodiversity conservation in river floodplain systems will benefit by considering the effects of flood homogenization and increased connectivity peculiar to these unique ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","Thomaz, Sidinei M;Bini, Luis Mauricio;Bozelli, Reinaldo Luiz",Scholarly Journals,2007,579,821237454,proquest,DC,MB,n,river-floodplain systems,n,chlorophyll and nutrients,water level,y,Combination of literature review and analysis of unpublished data
7,"hydrologic variability, water chemistry, and phytoplankton biomass in a large floodplain of the sacramento river, ca, u.s.a","The Yolo Bypass, a large, managed floodplain that discharges to the headwaters of the San Francisco Estuary, was studied before, during, and after a single, month-long inundation by the Sacramento River in winter and spring 2000. The primary objective was to identify hydrologic conditions and other factors that enhance production of phytoplankton biomass in the floodplain waters. Recent reductions in phytoplankton have limited secondary production in the river and estuary, and increased phytoplankton biomass is a restoration objective for this system. Chlorophyll a was used as a measure of phytoplankton biomass in this study. Chlorophyll a concentrations were low (<4 mug l-1) during inundation by the river when flow through the floodplain was high, but concentrations rapidly increased as river inflow decreased and the floodplain drained. Therefore, hydrologic conditions in the weeks following inundation by river inflow appeared most important for producing phytoplankton biomass in the floodplain. Discharges from local streams were important sources of water to the floodplain before and after inundation by the river, and they supplied dissolved inorganic nutrients while chlorophyll a was increasing. Discharge from the floodplain was enriched in chlorophyll a relative to downstream locations in the river and estuary during the initial draining and later when local stream inflows produced brief discharge pulses. Based on the observation that phytoplankton biomass peaks during drainage events, we suggest that phytoplankton production in the floodplain and biomass transport to downstream locations would be higher in years with multiple inundation and draining sequences.","Schemel, Laurence Edward; Sommer, Ted R.; Muller-Solger, Anke B.; Harrell, William C.",Scholarly Journals,2004,513,BIOSIS:PREV200400273679,wos,DC,RP,n,floodplain and river,y,chlorophyll-a,floodplain inundation,y,NA

9,fish assemblages of tropical floodplain lagoons: exploring the role of connectivity in a dry year,"Irregular rainfall and pronounced reductions of the hydrometric level in the year 2000 resulted in drastically altered hydrological connectivity of lentic environments in the upper Parana River floodplain. The objective of the present work was to examine spatial and temporal patterns of fish assemblage attributes and structure in relation to limnological variables associated with hydrological connectivity. Fish were collected quarterly by seining in the marginal areas of 15 lagoons belonging to two biotopic categories (connected and disconnected). Variation, in assemblage composition reflected the degree of hydrological connectivity. Values of assemblage attributes (species richness, density and biomass) were significantly lower in connected lagoons than in disconnected lagoons. Significantly higher values of species richness and biomass were recorded in November than in August. Rare species had the greatest effect on observed patterns in fish assemblage ordination (DCA). Observed patterns of variation in assemblage attributes were directly correlated with factors related to hydrological connectivity, such as depth, resources (zooplankton and chlorophyll a) and nutrients (total phosphorus).","Petry, Ana Cristina; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio; Gomes, Luiz Carlos",Scholarly Journals,2003,1,BIOSIS:PREV200510180551,wos,DC,LY,n,river floodplain,y,fish community composition and biomass,depth,y,"chla is included in predictors, but is not the main response variable, so may not work"
11,"land-sea connectivity, ecohydrology and holistic management of the great barrier reef and its catchments: time for a change","The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is an iconic and highly valued ecosystem in Queensland, Australia that is recognised internationally for its natural and cultural values. The coastal and marine ecosystems of the GBR are interconnected with the adjacent catchment area through hydrological connections. However, many GBR ecosystems are in a poor state, driven by several factors including a highly modified catchment. Land use changes over the last 160 years have led to development of agricultural land uses, modification of the coastal floodplains and loss of freshwater wetlands, and disruption of drainage and hydrological connections. These ecohydrological changes have led to declining water quality in catchment waterways and increases in the loads of pollutants that are delivered to the GBR, which predominantly occurs in wet season rainfall events. The Australian and State governments have recognised the need to address water quality issues for the GBR through management of the catchments, however, the management strategies adopted to date are largely associated with improvement of agricultural management practices and are not likely to be enough to maintain or restore the health of the GBR ecosystems. Future management strategies need to take into the account the need to protect, maintain and restore coastal ecosystems, system functions and land-sea connectivity if the values of the GBR are to be retained in the long term.

95,"microcrustacean (cladocera, copepoda, ostracoda) diversity in three side arms in the gemenc floodplain (danube river, hungary) in different hydrological situations","The microcrustacean assemblages, from different functional units of the Gemenc Floodplain (Danube River), were studied in various hydrological situations between 2002 and 2009. Sixty-three microcrustacean taxa were recorded from which 38 belonged to Cladocera, 18 to Copepoda and seven to Ostracoda. Among them there were some rare for the Middle Danube Region species, such as Dunhevedia crassa King, 1853, Holopedium gibberum Zaddach, 1855, Monospilus dispar (Sars, 1862). Significant differences were found between the different functional units of the floodplain focusing on the examined parameters of the microcrustacean assemblages. The most important factors influencing the species richness, as well as the density and diversity patterns of the assemblages, were the occurrence of flow, the connectivity with the main arm and the hydrological distance from the main arm. Most of these environmental factors are determined by the water level fluctuations of the Danube River which showed a negative correlation with all the examined parameters of the zooplankton assemblages. The density of the communities in both side arms correlated positively with the chlorophyll-a concentration. Moreover, the microcrustacean abundance showed an inverse relationship with the temperature but not in all of the side arms.","Kiss, Anita; Agoston-Szabo, Edit; Dinka, Maria; Schoell, Karoly; Berczik, Arpad",Scholarly Journals,2014,NA,BIOSIS:PREV201400560928,wos,MB,DC,n,river floodplain,y,microcrustancean community,"flow, connectivity with main arm and distance from main arm",y,"chla is included in predictors, but is not the main response variable, so may not work"
46,short-term succession of aquatic plant species richness along ecosystem productivity and dispersal gradients in shallow lakes,"Questions: The highest species richness is usually expected at an intermediate stage of development since the last major disturbance event, but some studies have shown that ecosystem productivity and dispersal may modify this pattern, suggesting the need for further studies on the effects of productivity and dispersal on the dynamics of species richness through succession. In this study, we analysed aquatic plant species richness in relation to (1) succession stage, measured as numbers of years since the last disturbance that affected the ecosystems; (2) lake productivity, measured as the chlorophyll a concentration; and (3) connectivity to similar nearby ecosystems, a proxy for the potential input of diaspores. Location: Shallow lakes of the Dombes region, France. Methods: Every 5-7 yr these shallow lakes are emptied and left to dry out for 1 yr. These drought disturbances lead to complete destruction of the submerged aquatic plant communities. Sixty lakes arranged along a gradient of productivity were selected. The probability of diaspore input was considered to increase from upstream to downstream, as lakes are organized in hydrologically connected networks via ditches, through which the downstream lakes receive water from the upstream lakes. For each lake, the aquatic plant species richness (from systematic summer vegetation sampling), time since the last disturbance (last summer drying), productivity (estimated as chlorophyll a concentration) and probability of diaspore input (assessed from position in the network) were recorded. Results: The aquatic plant species richness decreased with the time since the last disturbance for all of the lakes, but there was a significant interaction with the chlorophyll a concentration and position of the lake in the network. At the lowest ecosystem productivities, the relationship between successional stage and species richness was hump-shaped, whereas the species richness decreased with increasing time since the last disturbance when productivity increased. The lake's position in the network did not influence species richness during the first 2 yr after disturbance, but from year 3 and thereafter, lakes connected to high numbers of upstream lakes consistently exhibited decreased richness, contradicting the expected trend of increasing species richness with increasing diaspore inputs. Conclusions: This study indicates that both ecosystem productivity and connectivity strongly affected the relationship between aquatic plant species richness and succession, and that these factors should be taken into account in further developments of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. In this study, we analysed the effect of the lake productivity and the lake connectivity on the relationship between aquatic plant species richness and the succession stage. These factors affected the dynamics of species richness through succession and they should be taken into account in further developments of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. © 2012 International Association for Vegetation Science.","Arthaud, F;Vallod, D;Robin, J;Bornette, G;Wezel, A",Scholarly Journals,2013,24,1315882897,proquest,RP,DC,n,lake,y,"chlorophyll-a, aquatic plant species richness","degree of connection to other lakes, watershed position (upstream vs. downstream)",y,also includes a disturbance metric in analysis
7,"hydrological connectivity, and the exchange of organic matter and nutrients in a dynamic river-floodplain system (danube, austria)","1. The relationship between hydrological connectivity, and the exchange processes of suspended sediments, organic matter and nutrients (NO sub(3)-N) was investigated in a dynamically connected river-floodplain segment of the Danube over a 15-month period in 1995 and 1996 in the Alluvial Zone National Park, Austria. 2. Based on water level dynamics and water retention times, three phases of river-floodplain connectivity were identified: disconnection (phase I), seepage inflow (phase II) and upstream surface connection (phase III). The frequency of occurrence of these phases was 67.5%, 29.3% and 3.2%, respectively, during the study period. 3. A conceptual model is presented linking hydrological connectivity with ecological processes. Generally, the floodplain shifts from a closed and mainly biologically controlled ecosystem during phase I to an increasingly open and more hydrologically controlled system during phases II and III. Phase I, with internal processes dominating, is designated the 'biotic interaction phase'. 4. Phase II, with massive nutrient inputs to the floodplain yet relatively high residence times, and therefore, high algal biomass, is classified as the 'primary production phase'. This demonstrates that water level fluctuations well below bankfull may considerably enhance floodplain productivity. 5. Finally, since transport of particulate matter is mainly restricted to short flood pulses above bankfull level, phase III has been defined as the 'transport phase'. 6. The floodplain served as a major sink for suspended sediments (250 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)), FPOM (96 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)), particulate organic carbon (POC; 2.9 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)) and nitrate-nitrogen (0.96 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)), but was a source for dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 240 kg ha super(-1) year super(-1)), algal biomass (chlorophyll-a; 0.5 kg ha super(-1) year super(-1)) and CPOM (21 kg ha super(-1) year super(-1)). Considerable quantities of DOC and algal biomass were exported to the river channel during phase II, whereas particulate matter transport was largely restricted to the short floods of phase III. 7. The Danube Restoration Project will create a more gradual change between the individual phases by increasing hydrological connectivity between the river channel and the floodplain, and is predicted to enhance productivity by maintaining a balance between retention and export of nutrients and organic matter.","Tockner, K;Pennetzdorfer, D;Reiner, N;Schiemer, F;Ward, J V",Scholarly Journals,1999,41,17380345,proquest,DC,MB,n,river and floodplain,y,"algal biomass, dissolved organic carbon, CPOM, suspended sediments","categorized into three phases: disconnection, seepage inflow, upstream surface connection",y,
3,do environmental variables predict the trophic structure of fish fauna in a subtropical river (uruguay river ecoregion)?,"Trophic interactions represent the routes through which energy flows upwards within ecosystems and the understanding of such structuring under varying environmental conditions is still challenging. Here we test the hypothesis that differences in environmental variables act as environmental filters on the composition and trophic structure of local the fish fauna of a subtropical mountain river. We predict that differences in the trophic structure of the fish fauna occur along the river continuum. Main environmental parameters have been measured and fishes were sampled quarterly between August 2013 and May 2014 at six sampling sites in the main channel of the Pelotas River, Upper Uruguay ecoregion. We collected 3848 individuals belonging to 38 species, 4 orders and 11 families. The most (82.1%) consisted of small- and medium-sized individuals. The species were classified into eight trophic guilds: aquatic insectivorous, carnivorous, detritivorous, detritivorous/aquatic insectivorous, herbivorous, iliophagous, omnivorous and piscivorous. In general, herbivorous and piscivorous guilds were the most representative in both number and biomass. Significant differences detected by Permanova were for richness, numerical abundance and biomass between all the sites sampled. Relationships between the environmental variables and the composition of trophic guilds were observed along the longitudinal gradient by RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. The abundance of guilds omnivorous, aquatic insectivorous and herbivorous increases with higher values of chlorophyll- a and vegetation cover, especially characterizing the upstream sites (S1, S2 and S3). On the other hand, the abundance of the iliophagous, detritivorous/insectivorous and piscivorous guilds increases with greater values of width, temperature, inorganic phosphorus and total solids, a fact observed in downstream sites (S4, S5 and S6). Thus, it was possible to identify a clear variation in the trophic structure of the fish fauna along the Pelotas River (upstream-downstream), in which the local variables were efficient in predicting environmental filters that influence the trophic organization. In this scenario, our study follows the longitudinal model and evidences a greater accumulation of energy in food webs in the upstream-downstream direction, which favors the greatest abundance of piscivorous, detritivorous and iliophagous verified in stretches of greater volume and dimensions of river. These results highlight the importance of the local variables and the interrelationships in the lateral connectivity processes along the river continuum.","Neves, Mayara P;Baumgartner, Dirceu;Baumgartner, Gilmar;Delariva, Rosilene L",Scholarly Journals,2018,77,2417690740,proquest,MB,DC,n,river,y,"fish abundance, richness, biomass, and composition ",none,y,
