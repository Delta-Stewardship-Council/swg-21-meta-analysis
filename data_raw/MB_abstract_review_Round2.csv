r2_01,"Hydrologic connectivity and land cover affect floodplain lake water quality, fish abundance, and fish diversity in floodplain lakes of the Wabash?White River basin",,"Carlson Mazur, Martha L; Smith, Bradley; Bird, Broxton; McMillan, Sara; Pyron, Mark; Hauswald, Cassie",,2022,,,proquest,MB,NA,n,"floodplain lakes, oxbow lakes",y,water quality and fish diversity and abundance,more connected/less connected,yes,analyzed water quality and fish assemblage between floodplain lakes of differing connectivity; data collected includes chlorophyll-a
r2_02,Crossing Treeline: Bacterioplankton Communities of Alpine and Subalpine Rocky Mountain Lakes,,"Vincent, Kim; Holland-Moritz, Hannah; Solon, Adam J.; Gendron, Eli M. S.; Schmidt, Steven K.",,2022,,,WOS,MB,NA,n,alpine and subalpine lakes,y,bacterioplankton community composition,terrestrial-aquatic connectivity created by snowmelt,yes,"studied whether composition of bacterioplankton communitites differed above and below the treeline; compared 16s rDNA data from two time points, early summer an late summer; chlorophyll-a was measured"
r2_03,"Chlorophyll-nutrient relationship changes with lake type, season and small-bodied zooplankton in a set of subtropical shallow lakes",,"Wu, Bowen; Dai, Shiniu; Wen, Xinli; Qian, Chang; Luo, Fang; Xu, Jinqian; Wang, Xiaodong; Li, Ying; Xi, Yilong",,2022,,,proquest,MB,NA,n,subropical shallow lakes along Yangtze River,y,Chlorophyll-a,lakes divided into two categories urban with low water exchange rate and suburban with high connectivity,yes,studied how chlorophyll-a responded to abiotic factors and small zooplankton dynamics; seems like there could be confounding between the impacts of connectivity and the impacts of urbanization 
r2_04,COVID-19 lockdown effects on a coastal marine environment: Disentangling perception versus reality,,"Braga, Federica; Ciani, Daniele; Colella, Simone; Organelli, Emanuele; Pitarch, Jaime; Brando, Vittorio E; Bresciani, Mariano; Concha, Javier A; Giardino, Claudia; Scarpa, Gian Marco; Volpe, Gianluca; Rio, Marie-Hélène; Falcini, Federico",,2022,,,proquest,MB,NA,y,"marine, coastal, and inland",y,"water quality, chlorophyll-a",inland-marine connectivity,no,marine
r2_05,Variability in foodscapes and fish growth across a habitat mosaic: Implications for management and ecosystem restoration,,"Cordoleani, Flora; Holmes, Eric; Bell-Tilcock, Miranda; Johnson, Rachel C.; Jeffres, Carson",,2022,,,WOS,MB,NA,n,river and floodplain,y,"primary and secondary food production, fish growth rates","water residence time, habitat type",yes,"compared food production and fish growth between agricultural, wetland, and river habitats"
r2_06,Phytoplankton Sensitivity to Heavy Metals in Baltic Coastal Lakes,,"Szyma?ska-Walkiewicz, Monika; Gli?ska-Lewczuk, Katarzyna; Burandt, Pawe?; Obolewski, Krystian",,2022,,,proquest,MB,NA,y,lake and sea,y,"phytoplankton composition, biomass, and photosynthetic activity","lake-marine connectivity, salinity",no,marine; compared chlorophyll-a in phytoplankton groups in four coastal lakes that varried in connectivity to the sea; concluded that hydrologic factors were the main predictors of phytoplankton structure
r2_07,Influence of riverine connectivity on phytoplankton abundance and diversity of associated wetlands of River Ganga: A comparative study of an open and a closed wetland,,Supriti Bayen; Trupti Rani Mohanty; Thangjam Nirupada Chanu; Canciyal Johnson; Nitish Kumar Tiwari; Ranjan Kumar Manna; Himanshu Sekhar Swain; Basanta Kumar Das,,2021,,,proquest,MB,NA,n,river wetlands,y,plankton diversity and abundance,open vs closed wetland,yes,studied impact of river connectivity on plankton diversity and abundance; recommend reconnecting wetlands to improve their health
