chl_22,2,"b, c",yes,yes,no,monthly sampling using chla as surrogate for algal biomass and food web floodpulse concept
chl_51,1,"b, c, e",yes,no,no,chlorophyll in mainstem and trib during high water and falling water
chl_60,"1,2",a,no,no,no,difference in env vs. spatial variation for describing high protein weight DOM vs. more labile DOM.
chl_68,2,"c, d, e",yes,no,yes,biogeochemical comparison in connected small and large floodplain areas
chl_78,2,NA,no,no,no,"goals of paper were to derive chla critera based on cyanotox limits for drinking water supply. Connectivity was used to classify lake-river connections, but no mention of method. "
