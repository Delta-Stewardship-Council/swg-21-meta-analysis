1,dissolved organic matter characterization in soils and streams in a small coastal low-arctic catchment,r3_25,Ag_search_issue,"Ongoing climate warming in the western Canadian Arctic is leading to thawing of permafrost soils and subsequent mobilization of its organic matter pool. Part of this mobilized terrestrial organic matter enters the aquatic system as dissolved organic matter (DOM) and is laterally transported from land to sea. Mobilized organic matter is an important source of nutrients for ecosystems, as it is available for microbial breakdown, and thus a source of greenhouse gases. We are beginning to understand spatial controls on the release of DOM as well as the quantities and fate of this material in large Arctic rivers. Yet, these processes remain systematically understudied in small, high-Arctic watersheds, despite the fact that these watersheds experience the strongest warming rates in comparison. Here, we sampled soil (active layer and permafrost) and water (porewater and stream water) from a small ice wedge polygon (IWP) catchment along the Yukon coast, Canada, during the summer of 2018. We assessed the organic carbon (OC) quantity (using dissolved (DOC) and particulate OC (POC) concentrations and soil OC content), quality ( δ 13 C DOC, optical properties and source apportionment) and bioavailability (incubations; optical indices such as slope ratio, S r ; and humification index, HIX) along with stream water properties (temperature, T ; pH; electrical conductivity, EC; and water isotopes). We classify and compare different landscape units and their soil horizons that differ in microtopography and hydrological connectivity, giving rise to differences in drainage capacity. Our results show that porewater DOC concentrations and yield reflect drainage patterns and waterlogged conditions in the watershed. DOC yield (in mg DOC g - 1 soil OC ) generally increases with depth but shows a large variability near the transition zone (around the permafrost table). Active-layer porewater DOC generally is more labile than permafrost DOC, due to various reasons (heterogeneity, presence of a paleo-active-layer and sampling strategies). Despite these differences, the very long transport times of porewater DOC indicate that substantial processing occurs in soils prior to release into streams. Within the stream, DOC strongly dominates over POC, illustrated by DOC / POC ratios around 50, yet storm events decrease that ratio to around 5. Source apportionment of stream DOC suggests a contribution of around 50 % from permafrost/deep-active-layer OC, which contrasts with patterns observed in large Arctic rivers (12 ± 8 %; Wild et al.,&#xa0;2019). Our 10 d monitoring period demonstrated temporal DOC patterns on multiple scales (i.e.,&#xa0;diurnal patterns, storm events and longer-term trends), underlining the need for high-resolution long-term monitoring. First estimates of Black Creek annual DOC (8.2 ± 6.4 t DOC yr - 1 ) and POC (0.21 ± 0.20 t yr - 1 ) export allowed us to make a rough upscaling towards the entire Yukon Coastal Plain (34.51 ± 2.7 kt DOC yr - 1 and 8.93 ± 8.5 kt POC yr - 1 ). Rising Arctic temperatures, increases in runoff, soil organic matter (OM) leaching, permafrost thawing and primary production are likely to increase the net lateral OC flux. Consequently, altered lateral fluxes may have strong impacts on Arctic aquatic ecosystems and Arctic carbon cycling.","Speetjens, Niek Jesse;Tanski, George;Martin, Victoria;Wagner, Julia;Richter, Andreas;Hugelius, Gustaf;Boucher, Chris;Lodi, Rachele;Knoblauch, Christian;Koch, Boris P;Wünsch, Urban;Lantuit, Hugues;Vonk, Jorien E",2022,Agricultural & Environmental Science Collection,pro,MB,n,river,y,organic carbon,unclear,include,about carbon movement and processing between terrestrial and aquatic systems in the Arctic,NA

6,a floodplain-scale lake classification based on characteristics of macroinvertebrate assemblages and corresponding environmental properties,r3_01,June 30 search,"Floodplain lakes have been experiencing great pressures by human activities, and ecological functionsin different types of lakes show different degrees of degradation. For facilitating conservation and management of different types of floodplain lakes, it is necessary to classify the lakes into similar groups according to certain standards. In this study, on basis of consideration of macroinvertebrate assemblages and corresponding environmental properties, the Yangtze floodplain lakes were classified into three major types grouping five groups of lakes: (1) river-disconnected lakes (algal lakes, macrophytic-algal transition lakes, and macrophytic lakes), (2) semi-connected lakes (oxbow lakes), (3) river-connected lakes. The classification of floodplain lakes mainly reflects the gradients of trophic and hydrological connectivity. The key factors structuring macroinvertebrate assemblages in the Yangtze floodplain lakes were mainly hydrological (connectivity rating, water depth), trophic (total phosphorus, macrophytes biomass) and morphometric (development of lake shoreline). Among the floodplain lakes, ecological status of river-connected lakes, where biodiversity, biomass and production of macroinvertebrates reached maxima, has been confirmed to be the best. From the view of conservation and management of the entire floodplain lakes, it is suggested that protecting the remnants of river-connected lakes, controlling eutrophication and linking disconnected lakes freely with the mainstream are crucial.","Pan, Baozhu;Wang, Hongzhu;Wang, Haijun",2014,ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts,chla,MB,n,floodplain lakes,y,"macroinvertebrate assemblages, environmental conditions","river-disconnected, semi-connected, river-connected",include,classified floodplain lakes based on macroinvertebrate assemblage; found hydrologic connectivity to be a driving factor,NA
18,assessing seasonal eco-hydrological variability in lakes in the peace athabasca delta,r3_03,,"It has been accepted previously that flood events brought about river ice-jam flooding plays a important role in the biology and maintenance of the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) lakes through recharge of water volume and supplying nutrients to maintain the high productivity of deltaic lakes. While such assumptions are not unreasonable, little research has been done to test this theory. Ten PAD lakes positioned along a gradient of Evaporation/Inflow ratio were examined during 2003 with the goal of studying how the hydrologic setting influences the limnology of such waterbodies. The following questions were asked in this study: 1) Does hydraulic connectivity affect the nutrient and/or light regimes of deltaic lakes? 2) Does hydraulic connectivity affect productivity of macrophyte and phytoplankton communities? 3) Does hydraulic connectivity alter the seasonality of the limno-ecology of PAD lakes? Progress towards answering these questions goals were achieved through work of the previous summer (2003). Continuation of this work in the coming summer (2004) will allow for an examination of inter-year variability. In particular the possibility of contrasting the effects of differing ice break-up conditions on the seasonal development of limnological physical, chemical and biological conditions.","Wiklund, JA;Hall, R I",1,ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts,pro,MB,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,exclude,conference abstract,type
36,connectivity influences temporal variation of limnological conditions in missouri river scour lakes,r3_05,,"Two scour lakes in the Missouri River floodplain were sampled 20 months (April 1996-December 1997) to examine effects of river inflow on mixing, seston, and nutrient dynamics. Lake NC-11 ( approximately 4 ha) is deep ( approximately 16 m), sheltered, dimictic, and connected to the river only during floods. Lake S-19 ( approximately 20 ha) comprises two sub-basins, a deep ( approximately 12 m) riverine forewater perennially connected to the river and a shallow ( approximately 4 m), polymictic backwater of variable connectivity. Stratification in NC-11 affected, and was affected by, river inputs - cool inflows mixed completely and sometimes destratified the lake, warmer inflows were partly or completely confined to the epilimnion. Mixing between basins at S-19 was incomplete except during floods. During floods, concentrations of seston and particulate N and P were similar in the two basins of S-19, but conditions in the two basins diverged substantially during inter-flood periods as lower water levels reduced lateral exchange. Seston concentrations in NC-11 during floods were much less ( approximately 90% less) than in S-19 or the river. In NC-11, algal blooms (chlorophyll 50-90 mu g times L super(-1)) occurred in summer post-flood periods, but larger blooms (chlorophyll 50-256 mu g times L super(-1)) occurred in the S-19 backwater during periods of low connectivity in all seasons. Nitrate-N peaked at >2 mg times L super(-1) during floods but was exhausted during algal blooms along with up to approximately 90% of dissolved phosphorus. Silica declined sharply (up to 93%) in many, but not all blooms, but remained >0.5 mg times L super(-1) in all observations. Connectivity influenced many lake features and enhanced nutrient availability, but other floodplain lakes lacking river connections have similar algal biomass.","Knowlton, M F;Jones, J R",2003,ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts,chla,MB,n,floodplain lakes,y,"nutrient dynamics, mixing, seston","perennial connection, variable connection",include,"studied the impact of river inflow on mixing, seston, and nutrient dynamics in lakes with differing degrees of connectivity to the Missouri river",NA
56,effects of chloroplast–cytoplasm exchange and lateral mass transfer on slow induction of chlorophyll fluorescence in characeae,r3_07,,"Rapid cytoplasmic streaming in characean algae mediates communications between remote cell regions exposed to uneven irradiance. The metabolites exported from brightly illuminated chloroplasts spread along the internode with the liquid flow and cause transient changes in chlorophyll fluorescence at cell areas that are exposed to dim light or placed shortly in darkness. The largest distance to which the photometabolites can be transported has not yet been determined. Neither is it known if lateral transport has an influence on the induction of chlorophyll fluorescence. In this study, the relations between spatial connectivity of anchored chloroplasts in characean internodes and fluorescence induction curves were examined. Connectivity between remote cell parts was pronounced upon illumination of a cell spot at a distance up to 10 mm from the area of fluorescence measurement, provided the spot was located upstream in the cytoplasmic flow. Spatial interactions between distant cell sites were also manifested in strikingly different slow stages of fluorescence induction caused by narrow‐ and wide‐field illumination. Cytochalasin D, cooling of bath solution, and inactivation of light‐dependent envelope transporters were used to disturb cyclosis‐mediated spatial interactions. Although fluorescence induction curves induced by narrow‐ and wide‐field illumination differed greatly under control conditions, they became similar after the inhibition of cyclosis with cytochalasin D. The results indicate that cytoplasmic streaming not only drives the lateral translocation of photometabolites but also promotes the export of reducing power from illuminated chloroplasts due to flushing the chloroplast surface and keeping sharp concentration gradients.","Bulychev, Alexander A;Cherkashin, Alexander A;Shapiguzov, Stepan Yu;Alova, Anna V",2021,Agricultural & Environmental Science Collection,chla,MB,n,NA,y,NA,NA,exclude,"about chloroplasts, not landscape/hydrologic connectivity",connectivity
100,integrated fracture characterization of asmari reservoir in haftkel field,r3_09,,"The Asmari reservoir in Haftkel field is one of the most prolific naturally fractured reservoirs in the Zagros folded zone in the southwest of Iran. The primary production was commenced in 1928 and continued until 1976 with a plateau rate of 200,000 bbl/day for several years. There was an initial gas cap on the oil column. Gas injection was commenced in June 1976 and so far, 28% of the initial oil in place have been recovered. As far as we concerned, fracture network is a key factor in sustaining oil production; therefore, it needs to be characterized and results be deployed in designing new wells to sustain future production. Multidisciplinary fracture evaluation from well to reservoir scale is a great privilege to improve model’s accuracy as well as enhancing reliability of future development plan in an efficient manner. Fracture identification and modeling usually establish at well scale and translate to reservoir using analytical or numerical algorithms with the limited tie-points between wells. Evaluating fracture network from production data can significantly improve conventional workflow where limited inter-well information is available. By incorporating those evidences, the fracture modeling workflow can be optimized further where lateral and vertical connectivity is a concern. This paper begins with the fracture characterization whereby all available data are evaluated to determine fracture patterns and extension of fracture network across the field. As results, a consistent correlation is obtained between the temperature gradient and productivity of wells, also convection phenomenon is confirmed. The findings of this section help us in better understanding fracture network, hydrodynamic communication and variation of temperature. Fracture modeling is the next step where characteristics of fractures are determined according to the structural geology and stress directions. Also, the fault’s related fractures and density of fractures are determined. Meanwhile, the results of data evaluation are deployed into the fracture model to control distribution and characteristics of fracture network, thereby a better representation is obtained that can be used for evaluating production data and optimizing development plan.","Khadivi, Kourosh;Alinaghi, Mojtaba;Dehghani, Saeed;Soltani, Mehrbod;Hassani, Hamed;Mosavi, Seyed Chaseb;Shiralipour, Mansour;Fardin, Hashem;Sanjari, Sadegh;Partovi, Mohammad",2022,ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts,pro,MB,n,reservoir,y,NA,NA,exclude,"about modeling fracture patterns across a oil mining field, does not satisfy connectivity criteria",connectivity
106,"landscape controls on thermokarst lake water fluxes between inuvik and tuktoyaktuk, northwest territories, canada",r3_11,,"The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world, causing precipitation to shift from snowfall to rainfall, longer snow-free and ice-free summers, increased evapotranspiration, and permafrost thaw. It is necessary to understand how thermokarst lake water fluxes will react to these changes if we are to predict future greenhouse gas fluxes from lakes. Greenhouse gas fluxes from lakes are tied to the amount of lateral carbon delivery into the lake, the residence time of lake waters, and the temperature of lake waters, all of which are regulated by lake water fluxes and lake characteristics.

Greenhouse gas fluxes from lakes are tied to the amount of lateral carbon delivery into the lake, the residence time of lake waters, and the temperature of lake waters, all of which are regulated by lake water fluxes and lake characteristics. We measured lake water flux components at multiple spatial and temporal scales across the 5000 km (super 2) boreal-tundra transition zone between Inuvik and Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, Canada. Lake water flux components were measured at two adjacent thermokarst lakes with different ratios of lake area to catchment area (LACA), from 2017-2019. Also, stable water isotope samples were collected from March-September 2018 from approximately 100 lakes across 2000 km (super 2) . From these samples we estimated the ratio of evaporation to inflow, residence time, and the mixture of snowmelt and rainfall runoff in each lake. Catchments of all 7500 lakes in the region were delineated using a high-resolution digital elevation model in order to estimate their LACA, and evaluate connectivity between lakes. Lake temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, DOC, DON, and chlorophyll profiles were also measured from approximately 50 lakes pre-snowmelt in 2019.

123,opposing effects of climate and permafrost thaw on ch (sub 4) and co (sub 2) emissions from northern lakes,r3_13,,"Small, organic-rich lakes are important sources of methane (CH (sub 4) ) and carbon dioxide (CO (sub 2) ) to the atmosphere, yet the sensitivity of emissions to climate warming is poorly constrained and potentially influenced by permafrost thaw. Here, we monitored emissions from 20 peatland lakes across a 1,600 km permafrost transect in boreal western Canada. Contrary to expectations, we observed a shift from source to sink of CO (sub 2) for lakes warmer regions, driven by greater primary productivity associated with greater hydrological connectivity to lakes and nutrient availability in the absence of permafrost. Conversely, an 8-fold increase in CH (sub 4) emissions in warmer regions was associated with water temperature and shifts in microbial communities and dominant anaerobic processes. Our results suggest that the net radiative forcing from altered greenhouse gas emissions of northern peatland lakes this century will be dominated by increasing CH (sub 4) emissions and only partially offset by reduced CO (sub 2) emissions.

131,phytoplankton functional groups in a subtropical brazilian reservoir: responses to impoundment,r3_15,,"The discontinuity in rivers caused by the construction of reservoirs disrupts the longitudinal gradient and decreases the natural connectivity of lotic systems. We evaluated the dynamics of Reynolds functional groups (RFGs) in response to the formation of a subtropical reservoir, in relation to the environmental changes between the pre- and post-impoundment periods. We hypothesized that the disruption of longitudinal connectivity and the changes in the light and mixing regime after the impoundment would directly influence the phytoplankton functional structure. Significant changes in the light and mixing regimes were observed after the impoundment, with the formation of a lacustrine zone, influencing the dynamics of RFGs. Fourteen RFGs were recorded. RFG C (diatoms) dominated in the pre-impoundment period. In the post-impoundment period, RFGs C, P (diatoms), and J (chlorophyceans) codominated with the highest mean values of biovolume. RFGs MP, N, H1, W2, F, E, A, W1, B, X1, and S1 contributed relatively little to the biovolume, although with higher values in the post-impoundment period. RFGs F and S1 were recorded only after the impoundment. This study revealed the important roles of physical processes and nutrients in the spatial and seasonal gradient, and in the selection of phytoplankton functional groups in a subtropical reservoir.","Souza, Dayane Garcia;Bueno, Norma Catarina;Bortolini, Jascieli Carla;Rodrigues, Luzia Cleide;Bovo-Scomparin, Vania Mara;Souza Franco, Gilza Maria",2016,ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts,chla,MB,n,suptropical reservoir,y,"Reynolds functional groups, light and mixing regimes","longitudinal, pre and post impoundment",include,studied the impact of river impoundment on phytoplankton functional structure,NA
147,"solute transport dynamics in small, shallow groundwater-dominated agricultural catchments: insights from a high-frequency, multisolute 10 yr-long monitoring study",r3_17,,"High-frequency, long-term and multisolute measurements are required to assess the impact of human pressures on water quality due to (i) the high temporal and spatial variability of climate and human activity and (ii) the fact that chemical solutes combine short- and long-term dynamics. Such data series are scarce. This study, based on an original and unpublished time series from the Kervidy-Naizin headwater catchment (Brittany, France), aims to determine solute transfer processes and dynamics that characterise this strongly human-impacted catchment. The Kervidy-Naizin catchment is a temperate, intensive agricultural catchment, hydrologically controlled by shallow groundwater. Over 10 yr, five solutes (nitrate, sulphate, chloride, and dissolved organic and inorganic carbon) were monitored daily at the catchment outlet and roughly every four months in the shallow groundwater. The concentrations of all five solutes showed seasonal variations but the patterns of the variations differed from one solute to another. Nitrate and chloride exhibit rather smooth variations. In contrast, sulphate as well as organic and inorganic carbon is dominated by flood flushes. The observed nitrate and chloride patterns are typical of an intensive agricultural catchment hydrologically controlled by shallow groundwater. Nitrate and chloride originating mainly from organic fertilisers accumulated over several years in the shallow groundwater. They are seasonally exported when upland groundwater connects with the stream during the wet season. Conversely, sulphate as well as organic and inorganic carbon patterns are not specific to agricultural catchments. These solutes do not come from fertilisers and do not accumulate in soil or shallow groundwater; instead, they are biogeochemically produced in the catchment. The results allowed development of a generic classification system based on the specific temporal patterns and source locations of each solute. It also considers the stocking period and the dominant process that limits transport to the stream, i.e. the connectivity of the stocking compartment. This mechanistic classification can be applied to any chemical solute to help assess its origin, storage or production location and transfer mechanism in similar catchments.","Aubert, AH;Gascuel-Odoux, C;Gruau, G;Akkal, N;Faucheux, M;Fauvel, Y;Grimaldi, C;Hamon, Y;Jaffrezic, A;Lecoz-Boutnik, M",2013,ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts,chla,MB,n,"headwater catchment, groundwater and stream",y,"nitrate, sulphate, chloride, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon","unclear, related to flood pulses",include,measured solutes in stream and groundwater to study the solute transport in a human-impacted system,NA

Six synoptic surveys, two before, two during, and two after the 2002 monsoon season, encompassed periods of both low and high stream discharge. Chloride concentrations and delta super(18)O values during low-flow periods indicated the river was divided into three hydrologically distinct reaches each roughly 30 km long. Upper and lower reaches were characterized by areas of localized groundwater input followed by downstream evapo-concentration gradients, limited downstream solute transport, and highly variable carbon and nitrogen concentrations. In contrast, the middle reach was characterized by widespread groundwater input, continuous downstream hydrologic connectivity, and less variable carbon and nitrogen concentrations. During the monsoon season, base flow discharge increased five- to ten-fold, dissolved organic matter and inorganic N increased two- to ten-fold, Fluorescence Index (FI) values indicated a large input of terrestrial solutes, and both chloride concentrations and delta super(18)O values indicated that stream water and alluvial groundwater were well mixed along the entire 95 km reach. Concurrently, the middle reach that exhibited continuous hydrologic connectivity during the nonmonsoon season was a net sink for N, while the reaches characterized by limited hydrologic connectivity during the low-flow season exhibited net N export.

170,the production processes and characteristics of nitrogen pollution in bare sloping farmland in a karst region,r3_21,,"Nitrogen loss in karst sloping farmland will lead to declining land productivity and environmental pollution, in which the nitrogen loss through underground pore fissures will directly lead to groundwater pollution. The characteristics of total nitrogen (TN) production were studied by simulating the ""dual structure"" microenvironment of sloping farmland in a karst region using an artificial rainfall simulation method. The results show that rainfall was the main driving factor of TN loss in karst sloping farmland. TN was mainly lost through underground pore fissures when the rainfall intensity was ≤ 30 mm · h-1. TN was lost at the surface and underground when the rainfall intensity was ≥ 50 mm · h-1, TN loss on the surface accounted for a large proportion, and the surface flow was the main carrier of TN loss. The TN loss underground is easily ignored because it is hidden underground. Therefore, TN loss belowground in karst sloping farmland should receive increased attention. It would be interesting to explore the influences of connectivity and type of underground pore fissure system on TN loss in karst sloping farmland. The prevention and control of TN loss in karst sloping farmland should be considered both at the surface and underground. Reducing the formation of slope flows and slowing rainwater filtration by increasing slope vegetation coverage can be considered to reduce TN loss. The results of this study provide a theoretical reference for agricultural non-point source pollution control in a karst region.

183,trophic status of missouri river floodplain lakes in relation to basin type and connectivity,r3_23,,"Limnological data were collected over a two-year period from 12 lakes in the Missouri River floodplain in order to evaluate lake trophic status and the influence of basin type and connectivity on nutrient, seston, and phytoplankton dynamics. The lakes were located in west-central Missouri and included eight scour basins formed by levee breaks during a 1993 flood and four older oxbow lakes. The Missouri River was also sampled. Five of the scour basins (connected scours) were inundated by the Missouri River for varying periods during the study. The other lakes (protected lakes) were hydrologically isolated from the river by levees. On the basis of mean total phosphorus (TP - 61-282 mu g/L), mean total nitrogen (TN - 0.7-2.1 mg/L), mean chlorophyll (CHL - 22-67 mu g/L), and mean suspended solids (TSS - 16-93 mg/L), all 12 sites were highly eutrophic compared to other lakes in Missouri. Nutrient fractions and seston composition indicated dominance of inorganic nutrients and abiotic seston in the riverine lakes. Maximum concentrations of nutrients and TSS occurred in oxbow lakes during periods of sediment resuspension and in connected scours during floods in spring 1995 and 1996 when connected sites were inundated by the Missouri River. Algal blooms with peak CHL >200 mu g/L occurred sporadically in the oxbow lakes. Similarly large blooms (peak CHL 81-689 mu g/L) occurred in connected scours when low river levels reduced exchange with the river. Reduced connectivity was accompanied by rapid loss of dissolved N and P fractions, especially nitrate. Protected scours had lower average TP, TN, and TSS than the other sites and were less temporally variable.","Knowlton, M F;Jones, J R",1997,ASFA: Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts,chla,MB,n,floodplain lakes and river,y,"total phospohorus, mean total nitrogen, mean chlorophyll, mean suspended solids","seasonally connected, isolated from river ",include,seems highly relevant; describes impact of hydrologic connectivity with the river on various nutrients and chlorophyll,NA
