The performance of ecological cage aquaculture of pejerrey Odontesthes bonariensis in Pampean lakes under two different hydrological scenarios,"Ecological aquaculture promotes the development of sustainable farming systems, focusing on a wide range of ecosystem elements. The ecological aquaculture of the zooplanktivorous pejerrey ( Odontesthes bonariensis ) in floating cages in Pampean shallow lakes (Argentina) needs to be carried out considering the hydrological and chemical variations as modulators of plankton community and consequently of the pejerrey yield. To assess its performance in lakes with contrasting hydrological regimes, an experiment was carried out in two water bodies: La Salada de Monasterio Lake (Mon), an endorheic environment, and San Lorenzo Lake (Lor), connected to several lakes and the Salado River. During the experiment, regional rainfall generated high hydrological variability in Lor Lake changing its status of unconnected lake to a run?of?the?river lake. High standard deviation in Chlorophyll?a values in Lor indicated the significant effects of hydrological instability on the plankton community. Microcrustaceans abundance and biomass were higher in Mon, and almost disappeared in Lor when it turns into run?of?the?river. The final fish growth and survival were significantly higher in Mon, endorsing the importance of zooplankton of high nutritional quality and hydrological, physical–chemical and biological stability. The results indicate that productive and stable environments with a sustained offer of natural food are better for the zooplanktivorous fish production. Connectivity with other water bodies and hydrological dependence on rainfall regimes have defining effects on phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish production, thus emerging as key factors to be considered for achieving better results in the ecological aquaculture implementation.",2572363494,,,Scholarly Journals," Instituto de Limnología “Dr. Raúl Ringuelet” (ILPLA, CONICET CCT La Plata – UNLP), Buenos Aires, Argentina , Instituto de Limnología “Dr. Raúl Ringuelet” (ILPLA, CONICET CCT La Plata – UNLP), Buenos Aires, Argentina , Molecular Ecology Group, National Research Council of Italy, Water Research Institute (CNR?IRSA), Verbania, Italy , Instituto de Limnología “Dr. Raúl Ringuelet” (ILPLA, CONICET CCT La Plata – UNLP), Buenos Aires, Argentina , Cátedra de Medicina, Producción y Tecnología, Fauna Acuática y Terrestre, FCV, UBA, Buenos Aires, Argentina , Instituto de Limnología “Dr. Raúl Ringuelet” (ILPLA, CONICET CCT La Plata – UNLP), Buenos Aires, Argentina , Instituto de Limnología “Dr. Raúl Ringuelet” (ILPLA, CONICET CCT La Plata – UNLP), Buenos Aires, Argentina","Javier R Garcia de Souza;Moreno, Vivian Yorojo;Sathicq, María B;Gómez, Nora;Sampietro, Susana;Donadelli, Jorge;Colautti, Darío C",,, Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd,,,,, 10.1111/are.15316, Journal Article,, 2021-05-15, Oct 2021,,,,1355-557X,10, English, English,,, 4829-4840, Oxford,Oct 2021,Aquaculture Research,,2021,,,52,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/performance-ecological-cage-aquaculture-pejerrey/docview/2572363494/se-2?accountid=14505,,,,,,," 2021-04-15 (Revised) , 2020-09-07 (Received) , 2021-04-27 (Accepted)", 4829,,," Aquaculture , Lakes , Zooplankton , Fish , Modulators , Lakes , Phytoplankton , Rainfall , Chlorophylls , Biological effects , Aquaculture , Rivers , Hydrology , Rivers , Rainfall , Phytoplankton , Fish production , Fish , Ecological effects , Chlorophyll , Chlorophyll , Hydrologic regime , Phytoplankton , Zooplankton , Rainfall , Zooplankton , Lakes , Plankton , Stability , Phytoplankton , Zooplankton , Chlorophyll , Floating cages , Cages , Sustainable development , Aquaculture , Aquaculture , Aquaculture , Sustainable development , Survival , Sustainable agriculture , Natural & organic foods , Inland waters , Lakes , Natural & organic foods , Rainfall , Lakes , Hydrology , Odontesthes bonariensis"," connectivity , fish production , floating cages , hydrological influence , natural food availability",,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=The+performance+of+ecological+cage+aquaculture+of+pejerrey+Odontesthes+bonariensis+in+Pampean+lakes+under+two+different+hydrological+scenarios&amp;author=Javier+R+Garcia+de+Souza%3BMoreno%2C+Vivian+Yorojo%3BSathicq%2C+Mar%C3%ADa+B%3BG%C3%B3mez%2C+Nora%3BSampietro%2C+Susana%3BDonadelli%2C+Jorge%3BColautti%2C+Dar%C3%ADo+C&amp;volume=52&amp;issue=10&amp;spage=4829&amp;date=2021&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Aquaculture+Research&amp;issn=1355-557X&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aasfaaquaculture_,Natural Science Collection
"Water level as the key controlling regulator associated with nutrient and gross primary productivity changes in a large floodplain-lake system (Lake Poyang), China","A floodplain lake system can be described as a water conveyance-type lake system that is subject to high water-level fluctuations (WLFs). This study investigated the effects of WLF on the nutrient status and the gross primary productivity (GPP) of phytoplankton in Lake Poyang, a large floodplain-lake system in China. This study hypothesized that WLF is the key controlling regulator of the lake’s nutrient status, phytoplankton growth and GPP, driven by its influence on the lake’s hydrological connectivity in combination with water-flow velocity as well as other environmental parameters. The results showed that the intra-annual water levels in this lake varied from 7.61 m to 20.82 m while inter-annual water levels significantly decreased throughout 1989–2018 (P &lt; 0.05). Except for pH, most environmental variables and nutrients differed significantly each season. Mean GPP and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration during the water rising period was clearly higher compared to the dry season, wet season and falling period. Moreover, nutrient concentration was the main determining factor of phytoplankton growth and GPP during different periods, while water temperature (WT) also played a key role in influencing phytoplankton biomass and GPP during the water rising period. There was also a direct correlation between WLF and GPP during the water rising period, and WLF significantly affected nutrient concentration, subsequently impacting GPP. This study can benefit our overall knowledge of hydrological and ecological dynamics in floodplain-lake systems, while providing an important reference for policymakers in the management of dams and water quality in floodplain-lake systems globally.",2574374455, IND607363166,,Scholarly Journals," Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China","Wang, Shuoyue;Gao, Yang;Jia, Junjie;Kun, Sun;Lyu, Sidan;Li, Zhaoxi;Lu, Yao;Wen, Xuefa",,,," Wang, Shuoyue , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China , Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China",,,, 10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126414, Journal Article,,, Aug 2021,,,,0022-1694,, English, English,,,,,Aug 2021,Journal of hydrology, CSAPTjournals,2021, Elsevier B.V.," National Agricultural Library, © Elsevier B.V.",599,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/water-level-as-key-controlling-regulator/docview/2574374455/se-2?accountid=14505," Journal of hydrology, 2021 Aug., v. 599, Elsevier B.V., 0022-1694",,,,,," Journal of hydrology. 2021 Aug., v. 599 Elsevier B.V. , NAL-AP-2-clean , Available from publisher's site",,,," biomass , chlorophyll , dry season , floodplains , gross primary productivity , lakes , nutrient content , pH , phytoplankton , water flow , water quality , water temperature , wet season , China , China"," article , Water level , Primary productivity , Floodplain , Lake Poyang , article",,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Water+level+as+the+key+controlling+regulator+associated+with+nutrient+and+gross+primary+productivity+changes+in+a+large+floodplain-lake+system+%28Lake+Poyang%29%2C+China&amp;author=Wang%2C+Shuoyue%3BGao%2C+Yang%3BJia%2C+Junjie%3BKun%2C+Sun%3BLyu%2C+Sidan%3BLi%2C+Zhaoxi%3BLu%2C+Yao%3BWen%2C+Xuefa&amp;volume=599&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2021&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+hydrology&amp;issn=0022-1694&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagricolamodule_IND607363166,Natural Science Collection
Assessing the effects of lateral hydrological connectivity alteration on freshwater ecosystems: A meta-analysis,"The alteration of lateral hydrological connectivity (LHC) is among the major causes of decline in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services in river-floodplain ecosystems. Yet, the effects of LHC alteration on aquatic ecosystems have not been rigorously tested and synthesized. Here, we conducted a literature review and meta-analysis to provide a global synthesis of the effects of LHC alteration on aquatic ecosystems, and to test the effectiveness of indicators for bioassessment. In our review we found that the effects of LHC alteration were disproportionally documented in terms of geographic distribution and research subject. Most studies were conducted in Europe and America on the biodiversity and abundance of macroinvertebrates and fish. In our meta-analysis, we compared effect sizes between pairs of three LHC levels, i.e. disconnected, moderately connected, and highly connected. We found that only a limited number of water quality indicators (e.g. chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen) and biological community indicators (e.g. fish species richness, and zooplankton abundance) showed significant differences between LHC levels. The responses of these indicators to LHC alteration differed, and sometimes in opposing directions. We found out responsive indicators and their response trends, which could not only facilitate effective biomonitoring and bioassessment with regard to engineering and restoration of LHC, but also provide scientific underpinnings of the understanding of trade-offs among the indicators. We identified knowledge gaps and provided recommendations on how to fill these gaps, which included investigating rarely documented regions, developing new indicators, and quantifying mechanistic links between LHC and ecosystem functioning and services.",2524279576, IND607324695,,Scholarly Journals," Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China , Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China , Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China , Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China , Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China","Shen, Minghua;Liu, Xueqin",,,," Shen, Minghua , Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China , Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China",,,, 10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107572, Journal Article,,, Jun 2021,,,,1470-160X,, English, English,,,,,Jun 2021,Ecological indicators, CSAPTjournals,2021, Elsevier Ltd," National Agricultural Library, © Elsevier Ltd",125,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/assessing-effects-lateral-hydrological/docview/2524279576/se-2?accountid=14505," Ecological indicators, 2021 June, v. 125, Elsevier Ltd, 1470-160X",,,,,," Ecological indicators. 2021 June, v. 125 Elsevier Ltd , Available from publisher's site",,,," biological assessment , chlorophyll , dissolved oxygen , environmental monitoring , fish , freshwater , geographical distribution , macroinvertebrates , meta-analysis , species richness , total phosphorus , water quality , zooplankton , Europe , Europe"," article , Aquatic biota , Bioassessment , Indicator , Ecological restoration , Effect size , Water quality , article",,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Assessing+the+effects+of+lateral+hydrological+connectivity+alteration+on+freshwater+ecosystems%3A+A+meta-analysis&amp;author=Shen%2C+Minghua%3BLiu%2C+Xueqin&amp;volume=125&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2021&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Ecological+indicators&amp;issn=1470-160X&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagricolamodule_IND607324695,Natural Science Collection
Temporal Coherence Between Lake and Landscape Primary Productivity,"Understanding the patterns and drivers of primary productivity is a major goal of ecology, but little is known about whether the primary productivities of different types of ecosystems—here, lakes and the landscapes in which they are embedded—fluctuate in related ways through time. Due to shared climatic variation and well-known connections between lake and terrestrial ecosystems, such as nutrient and resource subsidies, we hypothesized that interannual fluctuations in aquatic and terrestrial primary productivity indices could be coherent. We also expected that lake and watershed characteristics could modify the strength and nature of primary productivity relationships. We applied wavelet coherence analyses to time series of lake chlorophyll-a and satellite-derived NDVI to examine coherence between lakes and land, and used random forest regression and generalized additive models to evaluate why coherence varies among lakes. There can be substantial coherence between lake and terrestrial primary productivity, but the strength and phase (direction and time lag) of this relationship vary widely, and there were marked differences between short (2–4-year periods of oscillation) and long (&gt;?4-year periods of oscillation) timescales. Across all timescales, variables associated with the connectedness of lakes to their watersheds were consistently the important explanatory variables of the strength and phase of coherence. The patterns observed in this study suggest the importance of cross-ecosystem flows, as opposed to shared climatic variation, in determining temporal coherence between lakes and the landscape.",2517102093,,,Scholarly Journals," University of Virginia, Department of Environmental Sciences, Charlottesville, USA (GRID:grid.27755.32) (ISNI:0000 0000 9136 933X) , Iowa State University, Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology, Ames, USA (GRID:grid.34421.30) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 7312) , University of Kansas, Kansas Applied Remote Sensing Program, Kansas Biological Survey, Lawrence, USA (GRID:grid.266515.3) (ISNI:0000 0001 2106 0692) , University of Virginia, Department of Environmental Sciences, Charlottesville, USA (GRID:grid.27755.32) (ISNI:0000 0000 9136 933X) , Iowa State University, Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology, Ames, USA (GRID:grid.34421.30) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 7312)","Walter, Jonathan A;Fleck, Rachel;Kastens, Jude H;Pace, Michael L;Wilkinson, Grace M",,," © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

"Complex hydroperiod induced carryover responses for survival, growth, and endurance of a pond-breeding amphibian.","Assessing carryover effects from the aquatic to the terrestrial stage of pond-breeding amphibians is critical as temperature and hydrologic regimes of temporary ponds continue to be altered as a result of climate change and other stressors. We evaluated carryover effects of hydroperiod length (50-62 days) on amphibian survival, developmental rates, and locomotor performance using a model organism, the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), through aquatic and terrestrial mesocosm experiments with individual tests of locomotor performance. We found that shorter hydroperiods (50 days) had low larval survival (0.44?±?0.03) compared to the 62-day hydroperiod (0.91?±?0.09) and increased developmental rates, resulting in smaller sizes at metamorphosis. We did not find evidence of carryover effects on terrestrial survival three months post-metamorphosis with all hydroperiod treatments showing high terrestrial survival (0.88?±?0.07). However, post-metamorphic frogs from the longer hydroperiod treatments grew faster and larger compared to individuals from shortest hydroperiods and performed significantly better during endurance trials at 18 °C. Disentangling complex carryover effects across multiple life stages in species with high phenotypic plasticity can shed light on the physiological capacity of species to respond to changing environments and inform mechanistic predictions of persistence in the face of anthropogenic stressors.",2494302612, 33635404,,Scholarly Journals,,"Thompson, Cassandra M;Popescu, Viorel D",,,," Thompson, Cassandra M", 2021-04-20, 2021-02-26, 2021-04-20, 10.1007/s00442-021-04881-3, Journal Article, 1432-1939, 2021-02-26, April 2021, Grant No. 11086-18.03-1116139, National Library of Medicine,,,4, English, English, MEDLINE,, 1071-1081,,April 2021,Oecologia, CSAPTjournals,2021, Germany,,195,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/complex-hydroperiod-induced-carryover-responses/docview/2494302612/se-2?accountid=14505," Oecologia, April 2021, 195(4):1071-1081",,,,,," Cited By:<br/>

"An abiotic typology and reference conditions for nutrients and chlorophyll-a in subtropical reservoirs (São Paulo State, Brazil).","The establishment of reference conditions and typology are two important steps in water resources management. The reference conditions enable the determination of how impacted an ecosystem is, while the typology facilitates the implementation of management procedures. A study of subtropical reservoirs in São Paulo State (Brazil) was performed to obtain (1) an abiotic typology, using principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (Ward's method with Euclidean distances), and (2) reference conditions for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the dry and rainy seasons for one of the established typologies. Two main statistical techniques were used: the lake population distribution approach and the trisection method. PCA identified an environmental gradient in the east-west direction, with reservoirs at higher latitudes and with larger dimensions in the west, and smaller reservoirs in eastern areas with higher altitude and higher average annual rainfall. The PCA and cluster analysis indicated that there were four main types of reservoirs. The nutrient criteria techniques, obtained for 13 type I rainy-east reservoirs, were not significantly different (t test, p &lt; 0.05). Although the methods resulted in similar reference conditions, one-way ANOVA indicated significant differences between the seasons for Chl-a, which levels were slightly higher in the rainy season. As far as we know, this is the first study to simultaneously provide an abiotic typology and reference conditions for chlorophyll-a and nutrients in different seasons, considering subtropical reservoirs in South America. This investigation makes an important contribution to the monitoring and management of subtropical reservoirs, and the promotion of dialog between the scientific community and managers, aiming at ensuring the sustainability of water bodies.",2465440501, 33245536,,Scholarly Journals,,"Cardoso-Silva, Sheila;Frascareli, Daniele;Silva, Daniel C V R;Figueira, Rubens César Lopes;Bittencourt, Marisa Dantas;Moschini-Carlos, Viviane;Pompêo, Marcelo",,,," Cardoso-Silva, Sheila", 2021-03-22, 2020-11-27, 2021-03-22, 10.1007/s11356-020-11507-3, Journal Article, 1614-7499, 2020-11-27, April 2021," 2014/22581-8 , 2016/17266-1 , 2016/15397-1 , PNPD , 88887.165060/2018-00", National Library of Medicine,,,13, English, English, MEDLINE,, 16029-16041,,April 2021,Environmental science and pollution research international, CSAPTjournals,2021, Germany,,28,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/abiotic-typology-reference-conditions-nutrients/docview/2465440501/se-2?accountid=14505," Environmental science and pollution research international, April 2021, 28(13):16029-16041"," 1406-65-1 , 27YLU75U4W , N762921K75 , YF5Q9EJC8Y",,,,," Cited By:<br/>

Seasonal variations in food web dynamics of floodplain lakes with contrasting hydrological connectivity in the Southern Gulf of Mexico,"Floodplains are some of the most productive and diverse ecosystems on Earth. The Usumacinta River Basin, in the Southern Gulf of Mexico, hosts several floodplain lakes, whose integrity is threatened by water resource development. We aimed to investigate how food webs in these ecosystems vary in relation to their hydrological connectivity and seasonal flood cycles. To do this, we combined analysis of water quality and stable isotopes in two lakes with permanent connection to the Usumacinta River and two isolated lakes during dry, early rainy and late rainy season. Significant differences in chlorophyll-a, nutrients and suspended solids were reflected in distinct trophic dynamics among lakes. Stable isotope analysis revealed that fish from all lakes relied predominantly on autochthonous primary production, but while phytoplankton was the dominant resource for fish in the isolated lakes, aquatic macrophytes made the highest contribution to consumers’ production in the connected lakes. Fish tended to have broader isotopic niches during the early rainy season, likely reflecting consumption of a wider range of resources following the first flow pulses of the year. Our study highlights the importance of hydrological connectivity and natural flow regimes to maintain the outstanding biodiversity and fishery yield of these floodplain ecosystems.",2574330225, IND607264791,,Scholarly Journals," Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, CONACYT-El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico , Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, CONACYT-El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico , Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, CONACYT-El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico , Departamento de Ciencias de la Sustentabilidad, El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico , Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico. rrodiles@ecosur.mx , Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, CONACYT-El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico , Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, CONACYT-El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico","Cazzanelli, Matteo;Soria-Barreto, Miriam;Castillo, María Mercedes;Rodiles-Hernández, Rocío",,,," Cazzanelli, Matteo , Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, CONACYT-El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico , Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, CONACYT-El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico",,,, 10.1007/s10750-020-04468-8, Journal Article,,, Feb 2021,,,,0018-8158,4, English, English,,, p. 773-797,,Feb 2021,Hydrobiologia, CSAPTjournals,2021, Springer International Publishing," National Agricultural Library, © Springer International Publishing",848,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/seasonal-variations-food-web-dynamics-floodplain/docview/2574330225/se-2?accountid=14505," Hydrobiologia, 2021 Feb., v. 848, no. 4, p. 773-797, Springer International Publishing, 0018-8158",,,,,," Hydrobiologia. 2021 Feb., v. 848, no. 4 Springer International Publishing , NAL-AP-2-clean , Available from publisher's site", 773,,," biodiversity , chlorophyll , fish , fisheries , floodplains , food webs , macrophytes , phytoplankton , primary productivity , resource management , rivers , stable isotopes , water analysis , water quality , watersheds , wet season , Gulf of Mexico , Gulf of Mexico"," article , article",,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Seasonal+variations+in+food+web+dynamics+of+floodplain+lakes+with+contrasting+hydrological+connectivity+in+the+Southern+Gulf+of+Mexico&amp;author=Cazzanelli%2C+Matteo%3BSoria-Barreto%2C+Miriam%3BCastillo%2C+Mar%C3%ADa+Mercedes%3BRodiles-Hern%C3%A1ndez%2C+Roc%C3%ADo&amp;volume=848&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=773&amp;date=2021&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Hydrobiologia&amp;issn=0018-8158&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagricolamodule_IND607264791,Natural Science Collection

Seasonal variations in food web dynamics of floodplain lakes with contrasting hydrological connectivity in the Southern Gulf of Mexico,"Floodplains are some of the most productive and diverse ecosystems on Earth. The Usumacinta River Basin, in the Southern Gulf of Mexico, hosts several floodplain lakes, whose integrity is threatened by water resource development. We aimed to investigate how food webs in these ecosystems vary in relation to their hydrological connectivity and seasonal flood cycles. To do this, we combined analysis of water quality and stable isotopes in two lakes with permanent connection to the Usumacinta River and two isolated lakes during dry, early rainy and late rainy season. Significant differences in chlorophyll-a, nutrients and suspended solids were reflected in distinct trophic dynamics among lakes. Stable isotope analysis revealed that fish from all lakes relied predominantly on autochthonous primary production, but while phytoplankton was the dominant resource for fish in the isolated lakes, aquatic macrophytes made the highest contribution to consumers’ production in the connected lakes. Fish tended to have broader isotopic niches during the early rainy season, likely reflecting consumption of a wider range of resources following the first flow pulses of the year. Our study highlights the importance of hydrological connectivity and natural flow regimes to maintain the outstanding biodiversity and fishery yield of these floodplain ecosystems.",2486293659,,,Scholarly Journals," CONACYT-El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, Chiapas, Mexico (GRID:grid.466631.0) (ISNI:0000 0004 1766 9683) , CONACYT-El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, Chiapas, Mexico (GRID:grid.466631.0) (ISNI:0000 0004 1766 9683); Universidad Autónoma del Carmen, Centro de Investigación de Ciencias Ambientales, Campeche, Mexico (GRID:grid.449264.9) (ISNI:0000 0004 0484 1114) , El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Departamento de Ciencias de la Sustentabilidad, Villahermosa, Mexico (GRID:grid.466631.0) (ISNI:0000 0004 1766 9683) , El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, Chiapas, Mexico (GRID:grid.466631.0) (ISNI:0000 0004 1766 9683)","Cazzanelli Matteo;Soria-Barreto, Miriam;Castillo, María Mercedes;Rodiles-Hernández Rocío",,, © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021. ,,,,, 10.1007/s10750-020-04468-8, Journal Article,, 2021-01-02, Feb 2021,,,,0018-8158,4, English, English,,, 773-797, Dordrecht,Feb 2021,Hydrobiologia,,2021,,,848,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/seasonal-variations-food-web-dynamics-floodplain/docview/2486293659/se-2?accountid=14505,,,,,,," 2020-11-17 (Registration) , 2020-05-26 (Received) , 2020-11-17 (Accepted) , 2020-11-09 (Rev-Recd)", 773,,," River basins , Fish , Food webs , Aquatic plants , Phytoplankton , Chlorophylls , River basins , Biodiversity , Floodplains , Primary production , Rivers , Phytoplankton , Seasonal variations , Fish , Niches , Flood plains , Chlorophyll , Resource development , Water resources , Natural flow , Resource development , Isotopes , Water resources development , Nutrients , Phytoplankton , Floodplains , Resource development , Ecosystems , Primary production , Stable isotopes , Rainy season , Connectivity , Nutrients , Seasonal variations , Biodiversity , Ecosystems , Inland waters , Lakes , Water resources , Lakes , Primary production , Ecosystems , Macrophytes , Niches , Fisheries , Lakes , River basins , Biodiversity , Solid suspensions , Water analysis , Hydrology , Water quality , Stable isotopes , Rainy season , Ecosystems , Suspended solids , Chlorophyll , Macrophytes , Food webs , Water quality , Food chains , Dynamics , Ecosystems , Phytoplankton , Water quality , Seasonal variations , Nutrients , Food webs , Suspended particulate matter , Isotopes , Chlorophyll , Biodiversity , Rainy season , Seasonal variations , Aquatic plants , River basins , Floodplains , Water quality , Lakes , Hydrology , Fisheries , Gulf of Mexico , Usumacinta River"," Food web structure , Bayesian mixing models , Community metrics , Flood pulse , Tropical fish , Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve",,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Seasonal+variations+in+food+web+dynamics+of+floodplain+lakes+with+contrasting+hydrological+connectivity+in+the+Southern+Gulf+of+Mexico&amp;author=Cazzanelli+Matteo%3BSoria-Barreto%2C+Miriam%3BCastillo%2C+Mar%C3%ADa+Mercedes%3BRodiles-Hern%C3%A1ndez+Roc%C3%ADo&amp;volume=848&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=773&amp;date=2021&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Hydrobiologia&amp;issn=0018-8158&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aaqualine_,Natural Science Collection
Circulation patterns of biogenic ions in Young Glacial areas.,"The paper focuses on the effect of ponds (geographically isolated wetlands) on water quality within internally drained areas in a river catchment. The important part of the study was the point of formation of a periodic hydrographic network of internally drained areas linked with a main river as well as the identification of the circulation pattern of ions in such a system. The aim of the study was to examine the extent to which ponds pollute the main river upon physical connection with it. Research has shown that ponds participate actively in material circulation-including that of water and biogenic ions. The hydrographic network in Young Glacial areas is subject to very large seasonal changes. In the study area, the total length of the stream network in the dry season equaled 12 km, while in the wet season almost 75 km. At the same time, almost 50% of the internally drained areas in the catchment became connected with the surface runoff network. Such large seasonal changes in the hydrographic network yield large changes in stream water chemistry. In the study area, only 6 ponds were linked to the stream network during the dry season, while in the wet season, this number increased to 125. The parts of catchments featuring the largest changes in the hydrographic network as well as the largest number of ponds temporarily linked with surface runoff networks were characterized by a high content of total nitrogen and phosphorus-up to 244.2 kg N km2 per month and 26.2 kg P km2 per month.",2475093102, 33389183,,Scholarly Journals,,"Pietruszy?ski, ?ukasz;Cie?li?ski, Roman",,,," Pietruszy?ski, ?ukasz", 2021-01-05, 2021-01-03, 2021-01-05, 10.1007/s10661-020-08799-w, Journal Article, 1573-2959, 2021-01-03," January 3, 2021",, National Library of Medicine,,,1, English, English, MEDLINE,, 19,,"January 3, 2021",Environmental monitoring and assessment, CSAPTjournals,2021, Netherlands,,193,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/circulation-patterns-biogenic-ions-young-glacial/docview/2475093102/se-2?accountid=14505," Environmental monitoring and assessment, January 3, 2021, 193(1):19", 27YLU75U4W,,,,," Cited By:<br/>

Greenhouse gas emissions from lakes along a permafrost gradient in Western Canada; climate feedback dominated by methane,"Small lakes with organic-rich sediments are important global sources of methane and carbon dioxide, yet emission sensitivity at high latitudes to climate change is poorly known and likely influenced by warming temperatures and permafrost thaw. In this study we monitored 20 lakes along a 1700 km transect from continuous permafrost to south of the permafrost boundary within the Mackenzie River Basin, a major global peatland region. Methane and carbon dioxide emissions from lakes had opposing trends across the permafrost gradient from north to south, with methane emissions increasing fourfold while carbon dioxide fluxes shifted from net sources to net sinks. Parallel increases from north to south in base cation, nutrient, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations suggest increased lake hydrological connectivity with both deep groundwater and shallow peatland porewater. However, methane and carbon dioxide emissions were decoupled, despite both having latitudinal trends, potentially due to different environmental drivers. Methane emissions were positively correlated with increasing water temperature and lake depth. Conversely, carbon dioxide emissions were negatively correlated with increasing nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations, predominantly found in the sporadic and permafrost free permafrost zones. Permafrost conditions thus likely play a key role in regulating lake productivity and carbon dioxide exchange. Our results suggest that both direct impacts of temperature change and indirectly effects of permafrost thaw will interact strongly with climate warming to determine future net greenhouse gas balance. Using spatial trends and simple atmospheric perturbation models to project future lake greenhouse gas emissions suggests a positive net radiative forcing this century dominated by increasing methane emissions that is only partially offset by reduced carbon dioxide emissions.",2541948953, 2021-036988,,Scholarly Journals," University of Alberta, Department of Renewable Resources","Kuhn, M A A;Thompson, L;Olefeldt, D;Anonymous", #07548, American Geophysical Union 2020 fall meeting," GeoRef, Copyright 2021, American Geosciences Institute.

"Suspended sediment, nutrients, and chlorophyll in tropical floodplain lakes with different patterns of hydrological connectivity","The ecological functioning of floodplain lakes is largely influenced by the interaction with the river mainstem. In this study, seasonal variation in water chemistry and the relationship with the river conditions were compared between floodplain lakes that differ in the level of connection to the Usumacinta River, the largest river of Mesoamerica. Samples for suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll a were collected through the year in lakes permanently connected to the river and in lakes that only received water from the Usumacinta for a short period during peak flow. Floodplain lakes showed higher total suspended solids than the river during the dry season while during the rainy season greater differences were observed between the river and the lakes, probably explained by higher concentrations in the river and greater sedimentation in the lakes. Greater organic matter content in the suspended solids was observed in the floodplain lakes, particularly in the more isolated lakes, likely related to high algal biomass. Nitrate concentrations were always higher in the river than in the lakes and lower nitrate concentrations occurred at the isolated lakes, suggesting that processes that remove nitrate occur through the year and are a common feature of floodplain lakes. Phosphorus in the connected lakes was higher than in the river only during the dry season, while in the isolated lakes concentrations were always greater than in the river. Chlorophyll a concentrations were higher in the connected lakes than in the river only during the dry season, while the more isolated lakes exhibited higher values through the year, showing signs of eutrophication. Suspended organic matter, nitrate, and chlorophyll showed larger differences between lake and river sites in the more isolated lakes, probably related to greater water residence time and its influence on primary production. Less connected lakes are more vulnerable to flow alteration because the brief period of connection to the river can be compromised and the effects of eutrophication exacerbated.",2439434677, IND606935911,,Scholarly Journals," Departamento de Ciencias de la Sustentabilidad, El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico , Departamento de Ciencias de la Sustentabilidad, El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico","Castillo, María M",,,," Castillo, María M , Departamento de Ciencias de la Sustentabilidad, El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico",,,, 10.1016/j.limno.2020.125767, Journal Article,,, May 2020,,,,0075-9511,, English, English,,,,,May 2020,Limnologica, CSAPTjournals,2020, Elsevier GmbH," National Agricultural Library, © Elsevier GmbH",82,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/suspended-sediment-nutrients-chlorophyll-tropical/docview/2439434677/se-2?accountid=14505," Limnologica, 2020 May, v. 82, Elsevier GmbH, 0075-9511",,,,,," Limnologica. 2020 May, v. 82 Elsevier GmbH , Available from publisher's site",,,," algae , biomass , chlorophyll , dry season , ecological function , eutrophication , floodplains , hydrochemistry , lakes , nitrates , nutrients , organic matter , phosphorus , primary productivity , rivers , seasonal variation , suspended sediment , total suspended solids , wet season , Central America , Central America"," article , Floodplain , Tropics , Seasonality , Connectivity , article",,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Suspended+sediment%2C+nutrients%2C+and+chlorophyll+in+tropical+floodplain+lakes+with+different+patterns+of+hydrological+connectivity&amp;author=Castillo%2C+Mar%C3%ADa+M&amp;volume=82&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2020&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Limnologica&amp;issn=0075-9511&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagricolamodule_IND606935911,Natural Science Collection
Patterns of fish communities and water quality in impounded lakes of China's south-to-north water diversion project,"Understanding the ecological impacts of large-scale hydraulic projects is critical for maintaining ecosystem health while meeting human water needs. It is, however, currently hindered by a lack of direct evidence on ecological impacts associated with this type of project particularly on water quality and fish communities. Here, we characterized patterns and variations of fish communities and water quality in five impounded lakes of the Chinese South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), with the aim of better understanding potential ecological impacts of inter-basin water transfers. We found that 1) the impacts of water transfer on water quality in the impounded lakes was generally characterized by hydrological parameters (e.g. total suspended solids, turbidity, transparency, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and total hardness) in an upstream-downstream direction; 2) increased hydrological connectivity may have favored biological invasion (e.g. Tridentiger bifasciatus) and promoted a potential biotic homogenization among the impounded lakes; and 3) there was a pattern of decreased fish abundance and biomass from the upstream to downstream lakes with fish communities strongly driven by changing water quality patterns across the impounded lakes. These findings improve our understanding of ecological impacts of large-scale hydraulic projects and provide a significant basis for water agencies with similar water transfer systems to optimize their water transfer management in order to minimize ecological impacts.",2388744981, IND606806591,,Scholarly Journals," State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China , State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China , State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China , ISEM, Universite? de Montpellier, CNRS, IRD, EPHE, Montpellier, France , State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China , State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China , State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China , International Joint Commission, Detroit, MI 48232, USA , State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China , State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China , State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China , State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China , State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China","Guo, Chuanbo;Chen, Yushun;Gozlan, Rodolphe E;Liu, Han;Lu, Ying;Qu, Xiao;Wang, Lizhu;Xia, Wentong;Xie, Songguang;Xiong, Fangyuan",,,," Guo, Chuanbo , State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China , State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China",,,, 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136515, Journal Article,,," Apr 15, 2020",,,,0048-9697,, English, English,,,,,"Apr 15, 2020",Science of the total environment, CSAPTjournals,2020, Elsevier B.V.," National Agricultural Library, © Elsevier B.V.",713,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/patterns-fish-communities-water-quality-impounded/docview/2388744981/se-2?accountid=14505," Science of the total environment, 2020 Apr. 15, v. 713, Elsevier B.V., 0048-9697",,,,,," Science of the total environment. 2020 Apr. 15, v. 713 Elsevier B.V. , Available from publisher's site",,,," biomass , chlorophyll , dissolved oxygen , ecological invasion , environmental health , environmental impact , fish , fish communities , hydrology , lakes , oxygen , total suspended solids , Tridentiger , turbidity , water hardness , China , China"," Biological invasion , Ecological assessment , Eutrophication , Inter-basin water division , Sustainable development , article , article",,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Patterns+of+fish+communities+and+water+quality+in+impounded+lakes+of+China%27s+south-to-north+water+diversion+project&amp;author=Guo%2C+Chuanbo%3BChen%2C+Yushun%3BGozlan%2C+Rodolphe+E%3BLiu%2C+Han%3BLu%2C+Ying%3BQu%2C+Xiao%3BWang%2C+Lizhu%3BXia%2C+Wentong%3BXie%2C+Songguang%3BXiong%2C+Fangyuan&amp;volume=713&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2020&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Science+of+the+total+environment&amp;issn=0048-9697&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagricolamodule_IND606806591,Natural Science Collection
Patterns of fish communities and water quality in impounded lakes of China's south-to-north water diversion project.,"Understanding the ecological impacts of large-scale hydraulic projects is critical for maintaining ecosystem health while meeting human water needs. It is, however, currently hindered by a lack of direct evidence on ecological impacts associated with this type of project particularly on water quality and fish communities. Here, we characterized patterns and variations of fish communities and water quality in five impounded lakes of the Chinese South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), with the aim of better understanding potential ecological impacts of inter-basin water transfers. We found that 1) the impacts of water transfer on water quality in the impounded lakes was generally characterized by hydrological parameters (e.g. total suspended solids, turbidity, transparency, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and total hardness) in an upstream-downstream direction; 2) increased hydrological connectivity may have favored biological invasion (e.g. Tridentiger bifasciatus) and promoted a potential biotic homogenization among the impounded lakes; and 3) there was a pattern of decreased fish abundance and biomass from the upstream to downstream lakes with fish communities strongly driven by changing water quality patterns across the impounded lakes.

Connectivity and habitat typology drive CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes across land–water interfaces in lowland rivers,"Lowland rivers are assumed to be a net source of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ). However, little is known about the contribution of marginal permanent and temporary riverine aquatic systems to river carbon metabolism. Elevation, in relation to flooding, hydro?morphological, and ecological features of such habitats, can affect the gas fluxes across the water–atmosphere interfaces and the periodically air?exposed riverbeds. This hypothesis was investigated in the lowland sector of the Po River (Northern Italy) from May to September 2008. Five different aquatic habitats were considered: the main river course; a backwater habitat; and three lateral lentic waterbodies—an oxbow and two quarry lakes of different age. The water mass was always CO 2 and CH 4 supersaturated, and gas fluxes were from the water to the atmosphere. In the highly dynamic river course and backwaters, CO 2 emission rates were nearly one order of magnitude greater than in the lentic and hypoxic oxbow and quarry lakes. By contrast, CH 4 fluxes peaked in the lentic, deeper, and permanent water bodies. At sediment–atmosphere interfaces, the CO 2 emissions increased along an organic matter, a water saturation, and a chlorophyll a gradient, attaining the maximum rates in the periodically air?exposed riverbed and marginal sandy sediments. These differences in gas fluxes resulted from either the submersion persistence or the alternation of submersion and emersion phases, which were ultimately due to the gap between elevation and river water variations. All this stresses the critical role of marginal aquatic habitats for river C budget.",2162166182,,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Chemistry, Life Sciences and Environmental Sustainability, University of Parma, Parma, Italy; Institute for Electromagnetic Sensing of the Environment, National Research Council, Milan, Italy , Department of Chemistry, Life Sciences and Environmental Sustainability, University of Parma, Parma, Italy , Department of Chemistry, Life Sciences and Environmental Sustainability, University of Parma, Parma, Italy , Department of Chemistry, Life Sciences and Environmental Sustainability, University of Parma, Parma, Italy , Department of Chemistry, Life Sciences and Environmental Sustainability, University of Parma, Parma, Italy","Rossano Bolpagni;Laini, Alex;Mutti, Tiziana;Viaroli, Pierluigi;Bartoli, Marco",,," © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,,, 10.1002/eco.2036, Journal Article,, 2018-09-14, Jan 2019,,,,1936-0584,1, English, English,,,, Oxford,Jan 2019,Ecohydrology,,2019,,,12,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/connectivity-habitat-typology-drive-co-sub-2-ch-4/docview/2162166182/se-2?accountid=14505,,,,,,," 2017-02-13 (Received) , 2018-06-20 (Revised) , 2018-08-15 (Accepted)",,,," Habitats , Organic matter , Saturation , Elevation , Chlorophylls , Methane , Metabolism , Hypoxia , Atmosphere , Rivers , Habitat , Interfaces , Rivers , Sediments , Fluvial sediments , Carbon dioxide , Rivers , Methane , Chlorophyll , Interfaces , Flooding , Aquatic habitats , Sediments , Aquatic habitats , Flooding , Rivers , Inland waters , Lakes , Methane , Elevation , River beds , Typology , Organic matter , Persistence , Lakes , Carbon dioxide , Habitats , Lakes , Metabolism , Typology , Rivers , Organic matter , Aquatic environment , Flooding , River beds , Carbon dioxide , Chlorophyll , Flooding , Organic matter , Hypoxia , Backwaters , Quarries , Sediments , Backwaters , Methane , Carbon dioxide , River water , Habitats , Carbon dioxide , Chlorophyll , Metabolism , Fluxes , Quarries , Emissions , Atmosphere , Lakes , Mud-water interfaces"," C fluxes , Po River , riverscape mosaic , temperate lowland rivers , water level variations",,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Connectivity+and+habitat+typology+drive+CO2+and+CH4+fluxes+across+land%26ndash%3Bwater+interfaces+in+lowland+rivers&amp;author=Rossano+Bolpagni%3BLaini%2C+Alex%3BMutti%2C+Tiziana%3BViaroli%2C+Pierluigi%3BBartoli%2C+Marco&amp;volume=12&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=&amp;date=2019&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Ecohydrology&amp;issn=1936-0584&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aaqualine_,Natural Science Collection
Shifts of environmental and phytoplankton variables in a regulated river: A spatial-driven analysis,"The longitudinal structure of the environmental and phytoplankton variables was investigated in the Ebro River (NE Spain), which is heavily affected by water abstraction and regulation. A first exploration indicated that the phytoplankton community did not resist the impact of reservoirs and barely recovered downstream of them. The spatial analysis showed that the responses of the phytoplankton and environmental variables were not uniform. The two set of variables revealed spatial variability discontinuities and river fragmentation upstream and downstream from the reservoirs. Reservoirs caused the replacement of spatially heterogeneous habitats by homogeneous spatially distributed water bodies, these new environmental conditions downstream benefiting the opportunist and cosmopolitan algal taxa.

Do environmental variables predict the trophic structure of fish fauna in a subtropical river (Uruguay River Ecoregion)?,"Trophic interactions represent the routes through which energy flows upwards within ecosystems and the understanding of such structuring under varying environmental conditions is still challenging. Here we test the hypothesis that differences in environmental variables act as environmental filters on the composition and trophic structure of local the fish fauna of a subtropical mountain river. We predict that differences in the trophic structure of the fish fauna occur along the river continuum. Main environmental parameters have been measured and fishes were sampled quarterly between August 2013 and May 2014 at six sampling sites in the main channel of the Pelotas River, Upper Uruguay ecoregion. We collected 3848 individuals belonging to 38 species, 4 orders and 11 families. The most (82.1%) consisted of small- and medium-sized individuals. The species were classified into eight trophic guilds: aquatic insectivorous, carnivorous, detritivorous, detritivorous/aquatic insectivorous, herbivorous, iliophagous, omnivorous and piscivorous. In general, herbivorous and piscivorous guilds were the most representative in both number and biomass. Significant differences detected by Permanova were for richness, numerical abundance and biomass between all the sites sampled. Relationships between the environmental variables and the composition of trophic guilds were observed along the longitudinal gradient by RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. The abundance of guilds omnivorous, aquatic insectivorous and herbivorous increases with higher values of chlorophyll- a and vegetation cover, especially characterizing the upstream sites (S1, S2 and S3). On the other hand, the abundance of the iliophagous, detritivorous/insectivorous and piscivorous guilds increases with greater values of width, temperature, inorganic phosphorus and total solids, a fact observed in downstream sites (S4, S5 and S6). Thus, it was possible to identify a clear variation in the trophic structure of the fish fauna along the Pelotas River (upstream-downstream), in which the local variables were efficient in predicting environmental filters that influence the trophic organization. In this scenario, our study follows the longitudinal model and evidences a greater accumulation of energy in food webs in the upstream-downstream direction, which favors the greatest abundance of piscivorous, detritivorous and iliophagous verified in stretches of greater volume and dimensions of river. These results highlight the importance of the local variables and the interrelationships in the lateral connectivity processes along the river continuum.",2417690740,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Neves, Mayara P;Baumgartner, Dirceu;Baumgartner, Gilmar;Delariva, Rosilene L",,," © 2018.

Do environmental variables predict the trophic structure of fish fauna in a subtropical river (Uruguay River Ecoregion)?,"Trophic interactions represent the routes through which energy flows upwards within ecosystems and the understanding of such structuring under varying environmental conditions is still challenging. In this study Authors test the hypothesis that differences in environmental variables act as environmental filters on the composition and trophic structure of local the fish fauna of a subtropical mountain river. Authors predict that differences in the trophic structure of the fish fauna occur along the river continuum. Main environmental parameters have been measured and fishes were sampled quarterly between August 2013 and May 2014 at 6 sampling sites in the main channel of the Pelotas River (Upper Uruguay ecoregion). Authors collected 3848 individuals belonging to 38 species, 4 orders and 11 families. The most (82.1%) consisted of small- and medium-sized individuals. The species were classified into 8 trophic guilds: aquatic insectivorous, carnivorous, detritivorous, detritivorous/aquatic insectivorous, herbivorous, iliophagous, omnivorous and piscivorous. In general, herbivorous and piscivorous guilds were the most representative in both number and biomass. Significant differences detected by Permanova were for richness, numerical abundance and biomass between all the sites sampled. Relationships between the environmental variables and the composition of trophic guilds were observed along the longitudinal gradient by RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. The abundance of guilds omnivorous, aquatic insectivorous and herbivorous increases with higher values of chlorophyll-a and vegetation cover, especially characterizing the upstream sites (S1, S2 and S3). On the other hand, the abundance of the iliophagous, detritivorous/insectivorous and piscivorous guilds increases with greater values of width, temperature, inorganic phosphorus and total solids, a fact observed in downstream sites (S4, S5 and S6). Thus, it was possible to identify a clear variation in the trophic structure of the fish fauna along the Pelotas River (upstream-downstream), in which the local variables were efficient in predicting environmental filters that influence the trophic organization. In this scenario, study follows the longitudinal model and evidences a greater accumulation of energy in food webs in the upstream-downstream direction, which favors the greatest abundance of piscivorous, detritivorous and iliophagous verified in stretches of greater volume and dimensions of river.

"Biological responses to recent eutrophication and hydrologic changes in Xingyun Lake, southwest China","The synergistic influence of multiple environmental stressors on lake ecosystems has typically been evaluated paleolimnologically, through examination of a single biological indicator. Aquatic organisms, however, may display heterogeneous responses because of differences in their ecological sensitivity, and/or because of ecological consequences caused by strong interactions among multiple stressors. We applied paleolimnological methods to compare patterns of algal and invertebrate response to multiple stressors in a large, shallow lake in southwest China over the last two centuries. Our multi-proxy records show a clear trajectory of lake eutrophication (greater total nitrogen) and increasing lake productivity (greater sediment Chlorophyll-a concentration) during the last century. Nutrient enrichment and lake productivity played significant, but different roles, in structuring diatom and cladoceran assemblages, accounting for 31.4 and 77.3% of the total variance in the communities, respectively. Furthermore, there was a pronounced influx of the endemic diatom species Cyclotella rhomboideo-elliptica Skuja, which was strongly associated with the second axis of a diatom PCA (Principal Component Analysis). This occurred synchronously with a documented reversal of hydrological connectivity with a downstream, nutrient-poor lake during the early twentieth century, suggesting a role for species dispersal in modulating community reorganization. There are also strong differences between the two organism groups in their sensitivity to hydrological fluctuations, as hydrodynamics, indicated by sand content, was a significant driver for cladocerans (>25%), but showed only minor influence on diatom assemblages in our selection of minimum adequate models. The proportion of the total variance explained by our measured variables (<30%) was much lower for diatom assemblages than for both cladoceran assemblage and accumulation data ( approximately 77%), reflecting differences in community reorganization between the two biological indicators. The sediment-based evaluation of community responses revealed the differential impact of eutrophication and hydrological fluctuations on the biota of this large, shallow lake. Therefore, multiple biological indicators should be evaluated in limnological surveys to assess the full scope of ecological changes in highly stressed lake systems targeted for conservation or restoration.

"So close, so far: differences in long-term chlorophyll a variability in three nearby estuarine-coastal stations","Three sampling stations located in the inner Patos Lagoon estuary, the lagoon's mouth and the adjacent coastal beach were visited monthly from the end of 1992 until 2014. The stations are in close proximity, but are distributed along saline and hydrological gradients and had never previously been analysed together. Our main questions were: (1) Are the monthly, seasonal and interannual variations in chlorophyll a (Chl a) similar for the three stations? (2) Is there any type of connectivity among the sites? (3) What forces are responsible for controlling phytoplankton variability at these stations? The three stations showed distinct Chl a variability patterns, with higher concentration and variability at the beach station, where the seasonal variation presented higher values between May and October, seemingly out of phase with the estuarine station, where higher values occurred between September and January. The lagoon's mouth station acted as a transit region and incorporated the variability of the estuarine and coastal regions, and all three stations showed a lasting long-term influence from the remote and large-scale phenomenon El Nino Southern Oscillation, El Nino and La Nina periods being characterized by an increase in rainfall and drought conditions, respectively, in the region. The three stations showed no clear connectivity since the cross correlation analysis did not indicate subsequent (more than one month) influence of any station on the others with regard to Chl a. However, a large transfer of the surf-zone diatom, Asterionellopsis guyunusae, from the coast towards the estuary was observed in an apparent 'inverted outwelling' process.

"So close, so far: differences in long-term chlorophyll a variability in three nearby estuarine-coastal stations","Three sampling stations located in the inner Patos Lagoon estuary, the lagoon's mouth and the adjacent coastal beach were visited monthly from the end of 1992 until 2014. The stations are in close proximity, but are distributed along saline and hydrological gradients and had never previously been analysed together. Our main questions were: (1) Are the monthly, seasonal and interannual variations in chlorophyll a (Chl a) similar for the three stations? (2) Is there any type of connectivity among the sites? (3) What forces are responsible for controlling phytoplankton variability at these stations? The three stations showed distinct Chl a variability patterns, with higher concentration and variability at the beach station, where the seasonal variation presented higher values between May and October, seemingly out of phase with the estuarine station, where higher values occurred between September and January. The lagoon's mouth station acted as a transit region and incorporated the variability of the estuarine and coastal regions, and all three stations showed a lasting long-term influence from the remote and large-scale phenomenon El Nino Southern Oscillation, El Nino and La Nina periods being characterized by an increase in rainfall and drought conditions, respectively, in the region. The three stations showed no clear connectivity since the cross correlation analysis did not indicate subsequent (more than one month) influence of any station on the others with regard to Chl a. However, a large transfer of the surf-zone diatom, Asterionellopsis guyunusae, from the coast towards the estuary was observed in an apparent 'inverted outwelling' process. Chl a variability did not show a straight relationship with most of the measured abiotic variables, indicating that other forces such as residence time may be of greater importance.",1901737432, PQ0004327266,,Scholarly Journals,,"Abreu, Paulo Cesar;Marangoni, Juliano;Odebrecht, Clarisse",,,," Abreu, Paulo Cesar",,,, 10.1080/17451000.2016.1189081, Journal Article, 1745-1019,," January 2, 2017",,,,1745-1000,1, English, English,,, 9-21,,"January 2, 2017",Marine Biology Research, CSAPTjournals,2017," Taylor & Francis Group Ltd., 2 Park Square Oxford OX14 4RN United Kingdom",,13,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/so-close-far-differences-long-term-chlorophyll/docview/1901737432/se-2?accountid=14505," Marine Biology Research [Mar.

Phytoplankton dynamics in the Congo River,"We report a dataset of phytoplankton in the Congo River, acquired along a 1700-km stretch in the mainstem during high water (HW, December 2013) and falling water (FW, June 2014). Samples for phytoplankton analysis were collected in the main river, in tributaries and one lake, and various relevant environmental variables were measured. Phytoplankton biomass and composition were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and marker pigments and by microscopy. Primary production measurements were made using the ¹³C incubation technique. In addition, data are also reported from a 19-month regular sampling (bi-monthly) at a fixed station in the mainstem of the upper Congo (at the city of Kisangani). Chl a concentrations differed between the two periods studied: in the mainstem, they varied between 0.07 and 1.77 µg L¹ in HW conditions and between 1.13 and 7.68 µg L¹ in FW conditions. The relative contribution to phytoplankton biomass from tributaries (mostly black waters) and from a few permanent lakes was low, and the main confluences resulted in phytoplankton dilution. Based on marker pigment concentration, green algae (both chlorophytes and streptophytes) dominated in the mainstem in HW, whereas diatoms dominated in FW; cryptophytes and cyanobacteria were more abundant but still relatively low in the FW period, both in the tributaries and in the main channel. Daily integrated production measured in the mainstem (n = 15) varied between 64.3 and 434.1 mg C m² day¹ in FW conditions and between 51.5 and 247.6 mg C m² day¹ in HW. Phytoplankton biomass in the Congo River mainstem was likely constrained by hydrological factors (accumulation due to increased retention time during FW, dilution by increased discharge during HW), even though increased nutrient availability in the FW period might have also stimulated phytoplankton production. In contrast to other tropical river systems where connectivity with the floodplain and the presence of natural lakes and man-made reservoirs play a prominent role in the recruitment of phytoplankton to the main river, our results show that phytoplankton growth in the Congo River can take place in the main channel, with hydrological processes allowing maintenance of phytoplankton biomass even during HW.",2000461867, IND605715186,,Scholarly Journals," Unité d'Océanographie Chimique, Université de LiÃ¨ge, LiÃ¨ge, Belgium , Unité d'Océanographie Chimique, Université de LiÃ¨ge, LiÃ¨ge, Belgium , Unité d'Océanographie Chimique, Université de LiÃ¨ge, LiÃ¨ge, Belgium , Department of Botany, University of Sofia St. Kl.

Immigration and early life stages recruitment of the European flounder (Platichthys flesus) to an estuarine nursery: The influence of environmental factors,"Connectivity between coastal spawning grounds and estuarine nurseries is a critical step in the life cycle of many fish species. Larval immigration and transport-associated physical–biological processes are determinants of recruitment success to nursery areas. The recruitment of the European flounder, Platichthys flesus, to estuarine nurseries located at the southern edge of the species distribution range, has been usually investigated during its juvenile stages, while estuarine recruitment during the earlier planktonic life stage remains largely unstudied. The present study investigated the patterns of flounder larval recruitment and the influence of environmental factors on the immigration of the early life stages to the Lima estuary (NW Portugal), integrating data on fish larvae and post-settlement individuals (&lt;50mm length), collected over 7years. Late-stage larvae arrived at the estuary between February and July and peak abundances were observed in April. Post-settlement individuals (&lt;50mm) occurred later between April and October, whereas newly-settled ones (&lt;20mm) were found only in May and June. Variables associated with the spawning, survival and growth of larvae in the ocean (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a and inland hydrological variables) were the major drivers of flounder occurrence in the estuarine nursery. Although the adjacent coastal area is characterized by a current system with strong seasonality and mesoscale variability, we did not identify any influence of variables related with physical processes (currents and upwelling) on the occurrence of early life stages in the estuary. A wider knowledge on the influence of the coastal circulation variability and its associated effects upon ocean-estuarine connectivity is required to improve our understanding of the population dynamics of marine spawning fish that use estuarine nurseries.",2000151948, IND605270214,,Scholarly Journals," Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Porto (ICBAS-UP), 4050-313 Porto, Portugal; CIIMAR — Interdisciplinary Centre for Marine and Environmental Research, Rua dos Bragas, 289, 4050-123 Porto, Portugal , Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Porto (ICBAS-UP), 4050-313 Porto, Portugal; CIIMAR — Interdisciplinary Centre for Marine and Environmental Research, Rua dos Bragas, 289, 4050-123 Porto, Portugal , Institute of Estuarine & Coastal Studies, University of Hull, Hull HU6 7RX, UK , CIIMAR — Interdisciplinary Centre for Marine and Environmental Research, Rua dos Bragas, 289, 4050-123 Porto, Portugal; Institute of Estuarine & Coastal Studies, University of Hull, Hull HU6 7RX, UK , Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Porto (ICBAS-UP), 4050-313 Porto, Portugal; CIIMAR — Interdisciplinary Centre for Marine and Environmental Research, Rua dos Bragas, 289, 4050-123 Porto, Portugal","Amorim, Eva;Bordalo, Adriano A;Elliott, Michael;Ramos, Sandra",,,," Amorim, Eva , Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Porto (ICBAS-UP), 4050-313 Porto, Portugal; CIIMAR — Interdisciplinary Centre for Marine and Environmental Research, Rua dos Bragas, 289, 4050-123 Porto, Portugal",,,, 10.1016/j.seares.2015.07.005, Journal Article,,, Jan 2016,,,,1385-1101,, English, English,,, p. 56-66,,Jan 2016,Journal of sea research, CSAPTjournals,2016, Elsevier B.V.," National Agricultural Library, © Elsevier B.V.",107,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/immigration-early-life-stages-recruitment/docview/2000151948/se-2?accountid=14505," Journal of sea research, 2016 Jan., v. 107, p. 56-66, Elsevier B.V., 1385-1101",,,,,," Journal of sea research. 2016 Jan., v. 107 Elsevier B.V. , Available from publisher's site", 56,,," biogeography , chlorophyll , coasts , environmental factors , estuaries , fish larvae , flounder , hydrology , immigration , juveniles , plankton , Platichthys flesus , population dynamics , spawning , surface water temperature , Portugal , Portugal"," Estuarine recruitment , Juveniles , Larvae , Physical–biological processes , article , article",,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Immigration+and+early+life+stages+recruitment+of+the+European+flounder+%28Platichthys+flesus%29+to+an+estuarine+nursery%3A+The+influence+of+environmental+factors&amp;author=Amorim%2C+Eva%3BBordalo%2C+Adriano+A%3BElliott%2C+Michael%3BRamos%2C+Sandra&amp;volume=107&amp;issue=&amp;spage=56&amp;date=2016&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+sea+research&amp;issn=1385-1101&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagricolamodule_IND605270214,Natural Science Collection

Abiotic variability among different aquatic systems of the central Amazon floodplain during drought and flood events,"  This paper examines water properties from lakes, channels and paleo-channels located in Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve, in Central Amazon floodplain, Amazonas, Brazil. The authors analysed surface temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, transparency, suspended inorganic and organic matter, chlorophyll-a, pheophytin, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, organic and inorganic carbon in 2009 high water phase, 2009 and 2010 low water phases. Multivariate statistical analyses of 24 aquatic systems (6 ressacas, 12 lakes and 6 channels, 142 samples) were applied to the variables.

Abiotic variability among different aquatic systems of the central Amazon floodplain during drought and flood events.,"This paper examines water properties from lakes, (depression lakes, sensu Junk et al., 2012), channels (scroll lakes with high connectivity, sensu Junk et al., 2012) and paleo-channels (scroll lakes with low connectivity-sensu Junk et al., 2012, locally called ressacas) located in Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve, in Central Amazon floodplain, Amazonas, Brazil. We analysed surface temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, transparency, suspended inorganic and organic matter, chlorophyll-a, pheophytin, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, organic and inorganic carbon in 2009 high water phase, 2009 and 2010 low water phases. Multivariate statistical analyses of 24 aquatic systems (6 ressacas, 12 lakes and 6 channels, 142 samples) were applied to the variables in order to: 1) quantify differences among aquatic system types; 2) assess how those differences are affected in the different phases of the hydrological year. First, we analysed the entire set of variables to test for differences among phases of the hydrological year and types of aquatic systems using a PERMANOVA two-way crossed design. The results showed that the all measured limnological variables are distinct regarding both factors: types of aquatic systems and hydrological phases. In general, the magnitude and amplitude of all variables were higher in the low water phase than in the high water phase, except for water transparency in all aquatic system's types. PERMANOVA showed that the differences between aquatic system's types and hydrological phases of all variables were highly significant for both main factors (type and phase) and for the type x phase interaction. Limnological patterns of Amazon floodplain aquatic systems are highly dynamic, dependent on the surrounding environment, flood pulse, main river input and system type. These patterns show how undisturbed systems respond to natural variability in such a diverse environment, and how distinct are those aquatic systems, especially during the low water phase. Aquatic systems in Mamirauá floodplain represent limnological patterns of almost undisturbed areas and can be used as future reference for comparison with disturbed areas, such as those of the Lower Amazon, and as a baseline for studies on the effects of anthropogenic influences and climate change and on Amazon aquatic ecosystem.",1750431438, 26602352,,Scholarly Journals,,"Affonso, A G;Queiroz, H L;Novo, E M L M",,,," Affonso, A G", 2016-07-14, 2015-11-26, 2018-12-02, 10.1590/1519-6984.04214," Research Support, Non-u.s.

Towards deconfounding hydrological and seasonal temperature variability in the determination of selected limnological variables of a temperate floodplain ecosystem,"This paper presents a methodological approach that can aid the assessment of variation in limnological variables in response to hydrological phases and seasonal temperature variation. The investigation was conducted in the Danube River floodplain, Kopacki Rit, Croatia. The proposed approach facilitates a more accurate examination of the effects of first factor, while maintaining second factor less variable, and vice versa. Samples were collected in the floodplain channel and lake along a temporal connectivity gradient, and were grouped according to three hydrological phases (isolation, flow pulse and flood pulse) and according to three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). A permutational multivariate analysis of variance was used to analyse the hydrological effects within seasons, as well as seasonal effects within hydrological phases on selected limnological variables: pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nitrites, nitrates, ammonium, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a concentrations and ratio of copiotrophic to oligotrophic bacteria. A multivariate data cloud was structured by hydrological phases during all investigated seasons, but not by all seasons during different hydrological phases. The strongest impact of hydrological phases on limnological variables occurred during summer. Seasonal effects were significant during the isolation and the flood pulse phases. The flow pulse phase somehow obscured the effects of seasonal change, resulting in temporal floodplain homogenization. One possible explanation is that water temperature determines potential limnological conditions, whereas hydrology determines actual conditions. Such results must be taken into account if the accurate effects of hydrology and seasonal change are to be assessed in temperate floodplain ecosystems.

Hydrological pulse regulating the bacterial heterotrophic metabolism between Amazonian mainstems and floodplain lakes.,"We evaluated in situ rates of bacterial carbon processing in Amazonian floodplain lakes and mainstems, during both high water (HW) and low water (LW) phases (p &lt; 0.05). Our results showed that bacterial production (BP) was lower and more variable than bacterial respiration, determined as total respiration. Bacterial carbon demand was mostly accounted by BR and presented the same pattern that BR in both water phases. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) showed a wide range (0.2-23%) and low mean value of 3 and 6%, (in HW and LW, respectively) suggesting that dissolved organic carbon was mostly allocated to catabolic metabolism. However, BGE was regulated by BP in LW phase. Consequently, changes in BGE showed the same pattern that BP. In addition, the hydrological pulse effects on mainstems and floodplains lakes connectivity were found for BP and BGE in LW. Multiple correlation analyses revealed that indexes of organic matter (OM) quality (chlorophyll-a, N stable isotopes and C/N ratios) were the strongest seasonal drivers of bacterial carbon metabolism. Our work indicated that: (i) the bacterial metabolism was mostly driven by respiration in Amazonian aquatic ecosystems resulting in low BGE in either high or LW phase; (ii) the hydrological pulse regulated the bacterial heterotrophic metabolism between Amazonian mainstems and floodplain lakes mostly driven by OM quality.",1725025157, 26483776,,Scholarly Journals,,"Vidal, Luciana O;Abril, Gwenäel;Artigas, Luiz F;Melo, Michaela L;Bernardes, Marcelo C;Lobão, Lúcia M;Reis, Mariana C;Moreira-Turcq, Patrícia;Benedetti, Marc;Tornisielo, Valdemar L;Roland, Fabio",,,," Vidal, Luciana O", 2015-10-20, 2015-10-21, 2020-10-01, 10.3389/fmicb.2015.01054, Journal Article,, 2015-09-30, 2015,, National Library of Medicine,,1664-302X,, English, English, PUBMED-NOT-MEDLINE,, 1054,,2015,Frontiers in microbiology, CSAPTjournals,2015, Switzerland,,6,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/hydrological-pulse-regulating-bacterial/docview/1725025157/se-2," Frontiers in microbiology, 2015, 6:1054",,,,,," Cited By:<br/>

"Using Stressor-Response Models to Derive Numeric Nutrient Criteria for Lakes in the Eastern Plain Ecoregion, China","Lakes in the Eastern Plain ecoregion of China are typically shallow, experience large disturbances, and are hydrologically connected to rivers. In recent years, lake eutrophication in this ecoregion has intensified due to human activities. To determine important regional nutrient criteria, the effects of hydrologic features and disturbances should be taken into account. In this paper, annual average data were used to construct stressor-response models for each hydrological lake type identified for lakes in the Eastern Plain ecoregion. In these models, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) criteria were obtained from a chlorophyll a (Chl-a, response variable) threshold value. A Chl-a concentration of 4.73 mu gL super(-1) was identified as this threshold value, which was based on the cyanotoxin limits associated with drinking water supply. The three lake types, which differed in hydrological structure, had significantly different TN and TP criteria. For example, lakes connected to the Yangtze River (T sub(1)) had a TN criterion ranging from 0.594 to 0.838mgL super(-1), which was substantially higher than those for lakes that were never connected to the river (T sub(3), 0.234-0.422mgL super(-1)). The exception to this trend occurred for lakes that were historically but not currently connected to the river (T sub(2)) due to P-limitation in this lake type. However, there was little variability in the TP criterion among T sub(1), T sub(2), and T sub(3) lakes, the values of which ranged from 0.021 to 0.037, 0.023 to 0.042, and 0.028 to 0.041mgL super(-1), respectively. This study hypothesized that the hydrological connectivity between lakes and rivers could regulate the relationships between stressors and their biological responses in lakes in the Eastern Plain ecoregion, leading to variability in appropriate nutrient criteria for different lake types. Setting nutrient criteria for the entire ecoregion and for different lake types by using stressor-response models will make the criteria values more credible and defensible.",1627975893, 20942609,,Scholarly Journals,,"Zhang, Yali;Huo, Shouliang;Ma, Chunzi;Xi, Beidou;Li, Xiang;Liu, Hongliang",,,," Zhang, Yali",,,, 10.1002/clen.201300708, Journal Article, 1863-0669,, November 2014,,,,1863-0650,11, English, English,,, 1509-1517,,November 2014,"Clean: Soil, Air, Water", CSAPTjournals,2014," Wiley-Blackwell, 111 River Street Hoboken NJ 07030-5774 United States",,42,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/using-stressor-response-models-derive-numeric/docview/1627975893/se-2?accountid=14505," Clean: Soil, Air, Water [Clean Soil Air Water].

Effects of lake-basin morphological and hydrological characteristics on the eutrophication of shallow lakes in eastern China,"The Yangtze River floodplain contains numerous oxbow or riverine lakes, all of which were openly connected with the Yangtze River or its major tributaries prior to 1950s. However, stresses resulting from human settlement and utilization of catchment resources have exerted great pressures on these lake ecosystems changing their morphology, connectivity and trophic state lakes. This study examined the interaction of these changes and their impact on eutrophication for 90 shallow lakes in eastern China in 2008 to 2011. TN and TP in the study lakes had negative relationships with mean water depth (Zmean), but no single lake-basin characteristic was found to dominate chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) growth. Instead, water depth and surface area were found to interactively affect Chl-a concentrations in smaller lakes. That is, Chl-a concentration in the lakes with Zmean&gt;2m and surface area (SA)‰¤25km2 was significantly higher than that in relatively larger lakes with Zmean&gt;2m and SA&gt;25km2 (p-value‰¤0.038). Chl-a concentration was higher in the lakes located within the lower Yangtze River basin which had longer retention times, than in the lakes located within the middle Yangtze River basin, where flow velocity is relatively larger. As expected, the water quality was found to be better in the lakes hydraulically connected with rivers than in those isolated from the river. This study revealed that lake-basin morphology and hydrology dominated algal blooms in the highly eutrophic shallow lakes in eastern China.",2000316314, IND605465614,,Scholarly Journals," Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing, China , Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing, China , Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing, China , Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA , Inner Mongolia Agricultural University, Hohhot, China , Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing, China , Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing, China , Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China , Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing, China , Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing, China","Huang, Jian;Xu, Qiujin;Beidou Xi;Wang, Xixi;Jia, Keli;Huo, Shouliang;Su, Jing;Zhang, Ting;Li, Caole",,,," Huang, Jian , Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing, China",,,, 10.1016/j.jglr.2014.04.016, Journal Article,,, Sep 2014,,,,0380-1330,, English, English,,, p. 666-674,,Sep 2014,Journal of Great Lakes research, CSAPTjournals,2014, Elsevier B.V.," National Agricultural Library, © Elsevier B.V.",40,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/effects-lake-basin-morphological-hydrological/docview/2000316314/se-2?accountid=14505," Journal of Great Lakes research, 2014 Sept., v. 40, p. 666-674, Elsevier B.V., 0380-1330",,,,,," Journal of Great Lakes research. 2014 Sept., v. 40 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrological connectivity as most probable key driver of chlorophyll and nutrients in oxbow lakes of the Bug River (Poland),"Concentrations of chlorophyll, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, total phosphorus and suspended solids were analysed in 10 oxbow lakes of the Bug River in spring and summer. According to their connectivity with the river, all lakes were divided into 3 categories – lakes connected with the river channel but separated from the floodplain inputs, lakes connected with the river but receiving inputs from the floodplain and totally isolated lakes. Connected lakes showed significantly higher concentrations of available nutrients and chlorophyll but the relationship between the two variables was weak in the spring and non-existent in the summer. Suspended solids were also more abundant in connected than in isolated lakes. Analyses of the proportion of chlorophyll and particulate phosphorus in suspension led us to the conclusion that water movement in connected lakes inhibited sedimentation and kept algae in the water column.

According to their connectivity with the river, all lakes were divided into 3 categories - lakes connected with the river channel but separated from the floodplain inputs, lakes connected with the river but receiving inputs from the floodplain and totally isolated lakes. Connected lakes showed significantly higher concentrations of available nutrients and chlorophyll but the relationship between the two variables was weak in the spring and non-existent in the summer. Suspended solids were also more abundant in connected than in isolated lakes. Analyses of the proportion of chlorophyll and particulate phosphorus in suspension led us to the conclusion that water movement in connected lakes inhibited sedimentation and kept algae in the water column. Isolated oxbow lakes devoid of wind-driven mixing were more susceptible to algal sedimentation which would explain the differences observed between the two lake categories.",1520378265, 19664560,,Scholarly Journals,,"Kufel, Lech;Lesniczuk, Szymon",,,," Kufel, Lech",,,, 10.1016/j.limno.2013.10.008, Journal Article, 1873-5851,," March 1, 2014",,,,0075-9511,, English, English,,, 94-98,,"March 1, 2014",Limnologica, CSAPTjournals,2014," Elsevier B.V., P.O.

Hydrological connectivity and basin morphometry influence seasonal water-chemistry variations in tundra ponds of the northwestern Hudson Bay Lowlands,"Due to shallow depth and high surface area-to-volume ratio, ponds of the Hudson Bay Lowlands are vulnerable to climatic and hydrological changes, but relations between hydrological processes and limnological conditions remain unknown. Here, we measured water balance and limnological variables (water chemistry, suspended sediments, chlorophyll-a) at 20 ponds near Churchill (Manitoba) three times during the ice-free season of 2010 to explore relations among hydrological connectivity, basin morphometry, and water chemistry variations. Using principal components analysis, we identified that the ponds followed one of four distinctive ""seasonal water chemistry trajectories"" (SWCT1-4). Most of the ponds that lacked apparent hydrologic connectivity displayed SWCT1, characterized by rising alkalinity and ionic content between early June and late July due to evaporative concentration. In contrast, most ponds with apparent hydrological connectivity displayed SWCT2 or SWCT3, characterized by marked changes in suspended sediment and total nitrogen concentrations due to inflow that transferred allochthonous materials from the catchment. Ponds in SWCT2 likely possessed temporary hydrological connections during periods of relatively high water supply and exhibited marked decline of suspended sediment and total nitrogen content when hydrological connection was lost. Most ponds in SWCT3 maintained active hydrological connections during all or most of the ice-free season and possessed relatively high suspended sediment and total nitrogen concentrations throughout the season. Ponds in SWCT4 possessed relatively stable water chemistry due to greater water depth and local features that reduced wind-induced sediment resuspension.

Floodplain lake assessment and fish assemblage dynamics in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (Mississippi Alluvial Valley).,"Floodplain lakes in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (MAV) provide valuable freshwater resources for states in which they occur. Thirty lakes in portions of Mississippi and Arkansas were surveyed for chlorophyll-a fluorescence and turbidity using handheld meters to determine relationships between chlorophyll-a concentrations and suspended solids. High applicability of handheld meters in the MAV presents economic benefits for monitoring the numerous lakes in the region. Additionally, twelve lakes within Bear Creek watershed, Mississippi were studied to determine how hydrologic connectivity shapes fish communities. Isolated and permanently connected floodplain lakes exhibited characteristically lacustrine and rheophilic fish communities, respectively, diversifying fishery management opportunities. Lastly, spring diel temperature and oxygen dynamics, as well as juvenile fish communities, were assessed within three habitats in a floodplain lake - pelagic environment, margin and contiguous wetlands. Variability in temperature and oxygen across the three habitats promotes spring habitat heterogeneity while supporting distinct but overlapping juvenile fish assemblages.",1520375284, 19549497,,Books,,"Steiner Andrews, Caroline Noelle",,,," Steiner Andrews, Caroline Noelle",,,,, Book Monograph,,,"  0, 2013",,," 9781303296413 , 9781303296413",,02, English, English,,, 84,,"0, 2013","Masters Abstracts International.

Short-term succession of aquatic plant species richness along ecosystem productivity and dispersal gradients in shallow lakes,"Questions: The highest species richness is usually expected at an intermediate stage of development since the last major disturbance event, but some studies have shown that ecosystem productivity and dispersal may modify this pattern, suggesting the need for further studies on the effects of productivity and dispersal on the dynamics of species richness through succession. In this study, we analysed aquatic plant species richness in relation to (1) succession stage, measured as numbers of years since the last disturbance that affected the ecosystems; (2) lake productivity, measured as the chlorophyll a concentration; and (3) connectivity to similar nearby ecosystems, a proxy for the potential input of diaspores. Location: Shallow lakes of the Dombes region, France. Methods: Every 5-7 yr these shallow lakes are emptied and left to dry out for 1 yr. These drought disturbances lead to complete destruction of the submerged aquatic plant communities. Sixty lakes arranged along a gradient of productivity were selected. The probability of diaspore input was considered to increase from upstream to downstream, as lakes are organized in hydrologically connected networks via ditches, through which the downstream lakes receive water from the upstream lakes. For each lake, the aquatic plant species richness (from systematic summer vegetation sampling), time since the last disturbance (last summer drying), productivity (estimated as chlorophyll a concentration) and probability of diaspore input (assessed from position in the network) were recorded. Results: The aquatic plant species richness decreased with the time since the last disturbance for all of the lakes, but there was a significant interaction with the chlorophyll a concentration and position of the lake in the network. At the lowest ecosystem productivities, the relationship between successional stage and species richness was hump-shaped, whereas the species richness decreased with increasing time since the last disturbance when productivity increased. The lake's position in the network did not influence species richness during the first 2 yr after disturbance, but from year 3 and thereafter, lakes connected to high numbers of upstream lakes consistently exhibited decreased richness, contradicting the expected trend of increasing species richness with increasing diaspore inputs. Conclusions: This study indicates that both ecosystem productivity and connectivity strongly affected the relationship between aquatic plant species richness and succession, and that these factors should be taken into account in further developments of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. In this study, we analysed the effect of the lake productivity and the lake connectivity on the relationship between aquatic plant species richness and the succession stage. These factors affected the dynamics of species richness through succession and they should be taken into account in further developments of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. © 2012 International Association for Vegetation Science.",1315882897, 52035539,,Scholarly Journals,,"Arthaud, F;Vallod, D;Robin, J;Bornette, G;Wezel, A", JVESE,,," Arthaud, F",,,, 10.1111/j.1654-1103.2012.01436.x, Journal Article, 1654-1103,, Jan 2013,,,,1100-9233,1, English, English,,, 148-156,,Jan 2013,Journal of Vegetation Science, CSAPTjournals,2013, United States, Elsevier Pharma Development Group,24,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/short-term-succession-aquatic-plant-species/docview/1315882897/se-2?accountid=14505," Journal of Vegetation Science, vol. 24, no. 1, pp. 148-156, 2013",,,,,, 72 refs., 148,,," Connectivity , Disturbance , Dry period , Eutrophication , Macrophyte , Metacommunity , Nutrient , Temporary water"," CABSCLASS , 91.3.1.4, ECOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES , ECOLOGY OF COMMUNITIES/ECOSYSTEMS , Community/Ecosystem Structure , Species/area relationships , CABSCLASS , 91.3.2.2, ECOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES , ECOLOGY OF COMMUNITIES/ECOSYSTEMS , Community/Ecosystem Processes , Energetics and dynamics , CABSCLASS , 92.13.1.3, PLANT SCIENCE , ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY , Ecology , Community structure and processes",,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Short-term+succession+of+aquatic+plant+species+richness+along+ecosystem+productivity+and+dispersal+gradients+in+shallow+lakes&amp;author=Arthaud%2C+F%3BVallod%2C+D%3BRobin%2C+J%3BBornette%2C+G%3BWezel%2C+A&amp;volume=24&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=148&amp;date=2013&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Vegetation+Science&amp;issn=1100-9233&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aplantscience_52035539,Natural Science Collection
Abundance and Biomass Responses of Microbial Food Web Components to Hydrology and Environmental Gradients within a Floodplain of the River Danube,"This study investigated the relationships of time-dependent hydrological variability and selected microbial food web components. Samples were collected monthly from the Kopa?ki Rit floodplain in Croatia, over a period of 19 months, for analysis of bacterioplankton abundance, cell size and biomass; abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and nanophytoplankton; and concentration of chlorophyll a. Similar hydrological variability at different times of the year enabled partition of seasonal effects from hydrological changes on microbial community properties. The results suggested that, unlike some other studies investigating sites with different connectivity, bacterioplankton abundance, and phytoplankton abundance and biomass increased during lentic conditions. At increasing water level, nanophytoplankton showed lower sensitivity to disturbance in comparison with total phytoplankton biomass: this could prolong autotrophic conditions within the floodplain. Bacterioplankton biomass, unlike phytoplankton, was not impacted by hydrology. The bacterial biomass less affected by hydrological changes can be an important additional food component for the floodplain food web. The results also suggested a mechanism controlling bacterial cell size independent of hydrology, as bacterial cell size was significantly decreased as nanoflagellate abundance increased. Hydrology, regardless of seasonal sucession, has the potential to structure microbial food webs, supporting microbial development during lentic conditions. Conversely, other components appear unaffected by hydrology or may be more strongly controlled by biotic interactions.

"A Limnological Examination of the Southwestern Amazon, Madre de Dios, Peru.","This dissertation investigates the limnology of the southwestern Peruvian Amazon centered on the Madre de Dios department by examining first the geomorphology and then the ecology and biogeochemistry of the region's fluvial systems. Madre de Dios, Peru is world renowned for its prolific biodiversity and its location within the Andes biodiversity hotspot. It is also a site of study regarding the development of the Fitzcarrald Arch and that feature's geomorphological importance as the drainage center for the headwaters of the Madeira River--the Amazon's largest tributary and as well as its role as a physical divider of genetic evolution in the Amazon. Though each of these has been studied by a variety of prominent researchers, the ability to investigate all the aspects of this unique region is hampered by the lack of a regional geomorphological map. This study aims to fill that gap by using remote sensing techniques on digital elevation models, satellite imagery and soil, geology and geoecological maps already in publication to create a geomorphological map. The resulting map contains ten distinct landform types that exemplify the dominance of fluvial processes in shaping this landscape. The river terraces of the Madre de Dios River are delineated in their entirety as well as the various dissected relief units and previously undefined units. The demarcation of the boundaries of these geomorphic units will provide invaluable assistance to the selection of field sites by future researchers as well as insights into the origin of the high biodiversity indices of this region and aid in planning for biodiversity conservation. Secondly this study examines 25 tropical floodplain lakes along 300 km of the Manu River within the Manu National Park in the Madre de Dios department. Alternative stable state and regime shifts in shallow lakes typically have been examined in lakes in temperate and boreal regions and within anthropogenically disturbed basins but have rarely been studied in tropical or in undisturbed regions. In contrast this study focuses on a tropical region of virtually no human disturbance and evaluates the effects of hydrological variability on ecosystem structure and dynamics. Using satellite imagery a 23 yr timeline of ecological regime shifts in Amazon oxbow lakes or ""cochas"" is reconstructed. The study shows that almost 25% of the river's floodplain lakes experience periodic abrupt vegetative changes with an average 3.4% existing in an alternative stable state in any given year. State changes typically occur from a stable phytoplankton-dominated state to a short lived, <3 yr, floating macrophytic state and often occur independent of regional flooding. We theorize that multiple dynamics, both internal and external, drive vegetative regime shifts in the Manu but insufficient data yet exists in this remote region to identify the key processes. To complete the investigation of tropical limnology the third study compares and contrasts the nutrient-productivity ration of floodplain and non-floodplain lakes globally and regionally. For over 70 years a strong positive relationship between sestonic chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total phosphorus (TP) has been established with phosphorus generally viewed as the most limiting factor to productivity. Most of these studies, however, have focused on northern, temperate regions where the lakes are typically postglacial, isolated and fed by small streams. Relatively little work has been done on floodplain lakes which are semi or permanently connected to the river. This study examines the relationship between nutrients and productivity in floodplain lakes globally through an extensive literature synthesis. Values for total phosphorus, total nitrogen and chlorophyll-a were collected for 523 floodplain lakes, represented by 288 data points while 551 data points were collected for 5444 non-floodplain lakes. Analysis revealed that globally, floodplain lakes do not show any significant difference in the total phosphorus/chlorophyll-a relationship from that found in non-floodplain lakes but significant differences are seen between tropical and temperate lakes. We propose that the term 'floodplain' lake should serve as purely a geographical descriptor and that it is lacking as an ecological indicator. Instead factors such as precipitation seasonality, hydrological connectivity and regional flooding regimes are better indicators of high or low productivity in floodplain lakes.",1439231762, 18096875,,Books,,"Belcon, Alana Urnesha",,,," Belcon, Alana Urnesha",,,,, Book Monograph,,,"  0, 2012",,," 9781267282880 , 9781267282880",,08, English, English,,, 160,,"0, 2012","Dissertation Abstracts International.

Spatial connectivity in a large river system: resolving the sources and fate of dissolved organic matter.,"Large rivers are generally heterogeneous and productive systems that receive important inputs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial and in situ sources. Thus, they are likely to play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of the DOM flowing to the oceans. The asymmetric spatial gradient driven by directional flow and environmental heterogeneity contributes to the fate of DOM flowing downstream. Yet, the relative effects of spatial connectivity and environmental heterogeneity on DOM dynamics are poorly understood. For example, since environmental variables show spatial heterogeneity, the variation explained by environmental and spatial variables may be redundant. We used the St. Lawrence River (SLR) as a representative large river to resolve the unique influences of environmental heterogeneity and spatial connectivity on DOM dynamics. We used three-dimensional fluorescence matrices combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to characterize the DOM pool in the SLR. Seven fluorophores were modeled, of which two were identified to be of terrestrial origin and three from algal exudates. We measured a set of environmental variables that are known to drive the fate of DOM in aquatic systems. Additionally, we used asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM) modeling to take spatial connectivity into account. The combination of spatial and environmental models explained 85% of the DOM variation. We show that spatial connectivity is an important driver of DOM dynamics, as a large fraction of environmental heterogeneity was attributable to the asymmetric spatial gradient. Along the longitudinal axis, we noted a rapid increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), mostly controlled by terrestrial input of DOM originating from the tributaries. Variance partitioning demonstrated that freshly produced protein-like DOM was found to be the preferential substrate for heterotrophic bacteria undergoing rapid proliferation, while humic-like DOM was more correlated to the diffuse attenuation coefficient of UVA radiation.",903662303, 22073647,,Scholarly Journals,,"Massicotte, Philippe;Frenette, Jean-Jacques",,,," Massicotte, Philippe", 2011-12-22, 2011-11-12, 2019-09-18,," Research Support, Non-u.s.

"Serial discontinuity along the Descoberto River Basin, Central Brazil","Aim: The Descoberto Basin was studied as a discontinuous ecological system through one seasonal cycle (about one year), at 13 sampling sites; Methods: The connectivity was analyzed in relation to environmental and limnological characteristics along the length of the Descoberto River, and the variables that most influenced the different sampling sites were determined; Results: Sites K and L, located upstream and downstream of the entrance of the Melchior River, respectively, differed most in physical and chemical parameters. A Principal Components Analysis demonstrated that the system was more influenced spatially than temporally, with 74.57% of accumulated variance accounted for by the first two axes. High values of chloride, chlorophyll-a, BOD5, total phosphorus, and total organic carbon, as well as low dissolved-oxygen concentrations separated sites L and M from the others. Winter and spring were the seasons in which most parameters showed significant differences among the sites; Conclusions: The construction of the dam and waste discharge act as discontinuity factors affecting the referred system, mainly at middle region and lower patch, between the sites K and L. Besides the construction of the reservoir, the Melchior River, an extremely impacted system, affects the Descoberto River downstream from its entry. Important changes in water quality occur in the lower basin, especially downstream of the Descoberto Reservoir, with significant increases in nutrient concentrations, suspended solids, turbidity, and chlorophyll a, and therefore a decrease in water clarity.Original Abstract: Objetivo: A bacia do rio Descoberto foi estudada como um sistema descontinuo atraves de um ciclo sazonal (um ano) em 13 estacoes amostrais; Metodos: A conectividade foi analisada em relacao a caracteristicas ambientais e limnologicas ao longo eixo longitudinal do rio Descoberto e as variaveis que mais influenciaram as diferentes estacoes amostrais foram determinadas; Resultados: As estacoes K e L, localizadas a montante e jusante da entrada do rio Melchior, respectivamente, diferiram mais quanto aos parametros fisicos e qulmicos da agua. Uma analise de componentes principals (PCA) demonstrou que o sistema foi mais influenciado espacialmente que temporalmente, com 74,57% da variancia total acumulada nos dois primeiros eixos. Altos valores de cloreto, clorofila a, DBO5, fosforo total e carbono organico total, tanto quanto baixas concentracoes de oxigenio dissolvido separaram as estacoes L e M das demais. Inverno e primavera foram estacoes nas quais a maioria dos parametros apresentou diferencas significativas entre as estacoes; Conclusoes: A construcao do reservatorio e descargas de esgoto atuaram como fatores de descontinuidade afetando o referido sistema, principalmente no trecho medio do rio e no trecho inferior, entre estacoes K e L. O rio Melchior, a partir de sua entrada, afetou o rio Descoberto. Importantes mudancas na qualidade de agua ocorreram na bacia especialmente a jusante do reservatorio, com aumentos significativos de nutrientes, solidos suspensos, turbidez e clorofila a e, portanto, na diminuicao da transparencia da agua.",869576543, 14868788," Descontinuidade serial ao lonso da bacia do rio Descoberto, Brasil Central",Scholarly Journals,,"da Silva, WJ;Felisberto, SA;Fonseca, C P;das Gracas Machado de Souza, M",,,," da Silva, WJ",,,, 10.4322/actalb.02203011, Journal Article,,, September 2010,,,,0102-6712,3, English, English,," Descontinuidade serial ao lonso da bacia do rio Descoberto, Brasil Central", 344-355,,September 2010,Acta Limnologica Brasiliensia, CSAPTjournals,2010,,,22,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/serial-discontinuity-along-descoberto-river-basin/docview/869576543/se-2?accountid=14505," Acta Limnologica Brasiliensia [Acta Limnol.

Functional indicators of stream health: a river-basin approach,"Summary1. The efficacy of leaf-litter decomposition, sediment respiration, biofilm biomass, growth, chlorophyll a concentration and the autotrophic index (biofilm ash-free dry mass-chlorophyll a) and fungal biomass for detecting human-induced change was evaluated using 24 references and 15 disturbed stream sites located in central Portugal.2. Decomposition rates of alder (Alnus glutinosa) and oak (Quercus robur) leaves and sediment respiration rates were effective in discriminating impairment. Decomposition was negatively correlated with abiotic factors, such as ammonium and nitrite concentrations, connectivity and alterations in the hydrological regime, and positively correlated with nitrate concentration and oxygen concentration.

"Rotifer abundance, biomass, and secondary production after the recovery of hydrologic connectivity between a river and two marginal lakes (Sao Paulo, Brazil)","Rotifera density, biomass, and secondary production on two marginal lakes of Paranapanema River were compared after the recovery of hydrologic connectivity with the river (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Daily samplings were performed in limnetic zone of both lakes during the rainy season immediately after lateral inflow of water and, in the dry period, six months after hydrologic connectivity recovery. In order to identify the factors that affect rotifer population dynamics, lake water level, volume, depth, temperature, transparency, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, conductivity, suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a were determined. Variations of water physical and chemical factors that affect rotifer population were related to the lake-river degree of connection and to water level rising after drought. The water lateral inflow from the river resulted in an increase in lake water volume, depth, and transparency and a decrease in water pH, alkalinity, and suspended solids. The lake with the wider river connection, more frequent biota exchange, and larger amount of particulate and dissolved materials was richer and more diverse, while rotifer density, biomass, and productivity were lower in both periods studied. Density, biomass, and secondary production were higher in the lake with the smaller river connection and the higher physical and chemical stability. Our results show that the connectivity affects the limnological stability, associated to seasonality. Stable conditions, caused by low connectivity in dry periods, were related with high density, biomass and secondary production. Conversely, instability conditions in rainy periods were associated to elevated richness and diversity values, caused by exchange biota due to higher connectivity.",883018575, 15316758,,Scholarly Journals,,"Casanova, Silvia Maria Caglierani;Panarelli, Eliana Aparecida;Henry, Raoul",,,," Casanova, Silvia Maria Caglierani",,,, 10.1016/j.limno.2009.06.008, Journal Article, 1873-5851,, December 2009,,,,0075-9511,4, English, English,,, 292-301,,December 2009,Limnologica, CSAPTjournals,2009," Elsevier B.V., P.O.

"Factors Influencing Algal Biomass in Intermittently Connected, Subtropical Coastal Ponds","Microalgae may contribute more to salt marsh productivity than realized, underscoring the importance of understanding algal dynamics in such systems. Benthic and planktonic chlorophyll-a (surrogate for total algal biomass), sediment ash-free dry weight, total suspended solids, salinity, and nutrients were examined in intermittently connected marsh ponds in the subtropical Guadalupe Estuary, Texas, USA to determine the effects of hydrologic connections on algal biomass in this system. From May 2005 to May 2006, several high water events resulting in surface water connections between ponds and nearby tidal creeks occurred, followed by disconnection and, at times, pond desiccation. During periods of disconnection, algal biomass was higher in both the benthos and the water column than during connection events when flushing occurred. Since connection events did not increase NOx, the primary source of dissolved inorganic nitrogen seemed to be nutrient cycling within the ponds. Data at the aggregated level, i.e., chlorophyll-a, indicated this system followed the flood pulse concept. During high water events, algal biomass may be exported to supplement the tidal creek food web (aquatic), whereas during low water events accumulated biomass within the ponds feed the marsh food web (terrestrial), which includes blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and the whooping crane (Grus americana).",21126083, 11203248,,Scholarly Journals,,"Miller, Carrie J;Davis, Stephen E;Roelke, Daniel L;Li, Hsiu-Ping;Driffill, Matthew J",,,," Miller, Carrie J",,,, 10.1672/08-69.1, Journal Article,,, June 2009,,,,0277-5212,2, English, English,,, 759-771,,June 2009,Wetlands, CSAPTjournals,2009," Society of Wetland Scientists, P.O.

Spatial variability of zooplankton along a section of River Sio under different habitat conditions,"Many factors influence the abundance and species richness of zooplankton in river systems, including river hydrology, morphology, phytoplankton development and biotic interactions. River Sio discharges into Lake Victoria and forms a boundary between Kenya and Uganda at its middle and lower reaches. The river has an average discharge of 11.4 m3s-1 contributing 1.5% of riverine water input into Lake Victoria. Zooplankton community studies were carried out along a section of River Sio and its floodplain on the Ugandan side between November 2008 and January 2009. The main focus of the study was that River Sio zooplankton diversity; biomass and abundance patterns were expected to change with differing levels of lateral connectivity and habitat heterogeneity of the river plus its floodplain. Sampling along lateral and longitudinal transects of the river were done to investigate the effect of habitat heterogeneity subject to the river's flooding regimes on the abundance, composition and diversity of its zooplankton. Zooplankton samples were collected using a zooplankton net of mesh size 60/lm and a Schindler trap sampler for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Other factors determined were selected physico-chemical variables. Zooplankton and physical-chemical data were subjected to statistical analyses (ANOVA, multivariate, regression and correlation analyses) for significant tests after log transformation. The ordination of samples (sites and dates) of physical-chemical or biological variables was carried out using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Similarity and diversity indices were used to assess structural patterns. In total, 45 rotifer, 9 copepod and 7 cladocera species were identified. Mean zooplankton density and biomass of River Sio were lower in the main channel of the river compared to its floodplain sites. Significant habitat differences were observed for zooplankton composition and abundance but no seasonal biomass and density differences were identified. Nutrient levels of River Sio were found to be very low. Physicalchemical factors like chlorophyll-a showed strong influences on the zooplankton community structure. These findings suggest that both low and high river water levels and the availability of heterogeneous habitats are crucial for zooplankton development in River Sio. The high zooplankton density observed bears significance to the ecological functions of the river as a breeding and nursery ground for potamodromous fishes from Lake Victoria.",968183622, 16504902,,Books,,"Gimbo, R",,,," Gimbo, R",,,,," Book Monograph , Dissertation , Bibliography",,,"  0, 2009",,,,,, English, English,,, 72,,"0, 2009","UNESCO-IHE Institute for water Education, Netherland. 72 p. 2009."," CSAPTbooks , CSAPTchaptersessays , CSAPTdissertations",2009," UNESCO-IHE Institute for water Education, Netherland",,,https://www.proquest.com/books/spatial-variability-zooplankton-along-section/docview/968183622/se-2?accountid=14505," UNESCO-IHE Institute for water Education, Netherland. 72 p. 2009.",," Q1 08461 Plankton , SW 5010 Network design , AQ 00008 Effects of Pollution"," Q1 08461 Plankton , SW 5010 Network design , AQ 00008 Effects of Pollution",," Q1 08461 Plankton , SW 5010 Network design , AQ 00008 Effects of Pollution"," Physical medium: Printed matter; Author's Degree: MSC (Thesis); Includes 112 refs, 24 tables", 72," Q1 08461 Plankton , SW 5010 Network design , AQ 00008 Effects of Pollution",," Flood plains , Zooplankton , River fisheries , River beds , Flood Plains , Rivers , Lakes , Aquatic Habitats , Density , Zooplankton , Species Diversity , Biomass , Heterogeneity , Flood Plains , Rivers , Lakes , Aquatic Habitats , Density , Zooplankton , Species Diversity , Biomass , Heterogeneity , Africa, Victoria L. , Uganda, Victoria L. , Uganda , Kenya, Victoria L. , Freshwater",,,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=book&amp;atitle=&amp;author=Gimbo%2C+R&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=72&amp;date=0%2C+2009&amp;rft.btitle=Spatial+variability+of+zooplankton+along+a+section+of+River+Sio+under+different+habitat+conditions&amp;rft.jtitle=&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aaqualine_16504902,Natural Science Collection
"Rotifer abundance, biomass, and secondary production after the recovery of Hydrologic connectivity between a river and two marginal lakes (Sao Paulo, Brazil)","Rotifera density, biomass, and secondary production an two marginal lakes of Paranapanema River were compared after the recovery of hydrologic connectivity with the river (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Daily samplings were performed in limnetic zone of both lakes during the rainy season immediately after lateral inflow of water and, in the dry period, six months after hydrologic connectivity recovery. In order to identify the factors that affect rotifer population dynamics, lake water level, volume, depth, temperature, transparency, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, conductivity, suspended solids, nutrients, and Chlorophyll-a were determined. Variations of water physical and chemical factors that affect rotifer population were related to the lake-river degree of connection and to water level rising after drought. The water lateral inflow from the river resulted in an increase in lake water volume, depth, and transparency and a decrease in water pH, alkalinity, and suspended solids. The lake with the wider river connection, more frequent biota exchange, and larger amount of particulate and dissolved materials was richer and more diverse, while rotifer density, biomass, and productivity were lower in both periods studied. Density, biomass, and secondary production were higher in the lake with the smaller river connection and the higher physical and chemical stability. Our results show that the connectivity affects the limnological stability, associated to seasonality.

Spatial heterogeneity in trophic status of shallow lakes on the Boreal Plain: Influence of hydrologic setting,"We used metrics of surface water and groundwater connectivity as explanatory variables in nonparametric regression models to explain the spatial heterogeneity in trophic status of shallow lakes. The concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a) was used as an indicator of trophic status and was estimated from 17 Landsat images acquired during the end of summer (August) over a 20-year period from 1984 to 2003. A long-term median of Chl a was computed for each of 40 lakes on the basis of the 17-year data set. Hydrologic metrics explained 72% of the spatial variation in Chl a. The regression tree showed that lakes with a higher concentration of calcium plus magnesium (Ca + Mg) exhibited higher Chl a than lakes with a lower Ca + Mg. We hypothesized that this trend was a result of either higher internal nutrient loading in high Ca + Mg lakes due to groundwater discharge or differences in surficial geology. Among high Ca + Mg lakes, lakes with no inflowing streams had lower Chl a, while connected lakes had higher Chl a, possibly reflecting enhanced nutrient delivery to lakes connected to the stream network. Among low Ca + Mg lakes, lakes with larger wetland cover in their drainage basins had lower Chl a, while lakes with smaller wetland cover in their drainage basins had higher Chl a, possibly reflecting differential water loading rates between small and large wetlands that lead to either Chl a concentration or dilution. These results suggest that relatively simple hydrologic metrics can be used to predict the trophic status of lakes in this area of the boreal forest.",48182161, IND44122722,,Scholarly Journals,,"Sass, G Z;Creed, I F;Devito, K J",,,," Sass, G Z",,,,, Journal Article,,, Aug 2008,,,,0043-1397,8, English, English,,, p.

"The significance of side-arm connectivity for carbon dynamics of the River Danube, Austria","1. Side-arms connected to the main stem of the river are key areas for biogeochemical cycling in fluvial landscapes, exhibiting high rates of carbon processing. 2. This work focused on quantifying autochthonous and allochthonous carbon pools and, thereby, on comparing transport and transformation processes in a restored side-arm system of the River Danube (Regelsbrunn). We established a carbon budget and quantified carbon processing from March to September 2003. In addition, data from previous studies during 1997 to 1999 were assessed. 3. Gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration were estimated by diel oxygen time curves and an oxygen mass balance. Plankton primary production was determined to estimate its contribution to GPP under different hydrological conditions. 4. Based on the degree of connectivity, three hydrological phases were differentiated. Most of the organic matter, dominated by allochthonous carbon, was transported in the main channel and through the side-arm during floods, while at intermediate and low flows (and thus connectivity), transformation processes became more important and autochthonous carbon dominated the carbon pool. The side-arm system functioned as a sink for particulate matter [total suspended solids and particulate organic carbon (POC)] and a source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chlorophyll-a. 5. Autochthonous primary production of 4.2 t C day¹ in the side-arm was equivalent to about 20% of the allochthonous inputs of 20 t C day¹ (POC and DOC) entering the area at mean flow (1% of the discharge of the main channel). Pelagic photosynthesis was generally high at mean flow (1.3-3.8 g C m² day¹), and contributed up to 90% of system productivity. During long stagnant periods at low discharge, the side-arm was controlled by biological processes and a shift from planktonic to benthic activity occurred (benthic primary production of 0.4-14 g C m² day¹). 6. The transformation of the organic matter that passes through the side-arm under different hydrological conditions, points to the importance of these subsystems in contributing autochthonous carbon to the food web of the main channel.",47516161, IND44002403,,Scholarly Journals,,"Preiner, S;Drozdowski, I;Schagerl, M;Schiemer, F;Hein, T",,,," Preiner, S",,,, 10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01888.x, Journal Article,,, Feb 2008,,,,0046-5070,2, English, English,,, p. 238-252,,Feb 2008,Freshwater biology, CSAPTjournals,2008," Oxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltd"," National Agricultural Library, © Oxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltd",53,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/significance-side-arm-connectivity-carbon/docview/47516161/se-2?accountid=14505," Freshwater biology, 2008 Feb., v. 53, no. 2, p. 238-252, Oxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 0046-5070",,,,,," Freshwater biology. 2008 Feb., v. 53, no. 2 Oxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Available from publisher's Web site", 238,,," biogeochemical cycles , carbon , carbon sinks , chlorophyll , dissolved organic carbon , floods , food webs , landscapes , oxygen , particulate organic carbon , particulates , photosynthesis , plankton , primary productivity , rivers , total suspended solids , Austria , Danube River , Austria , Danube River"," article , floodplain , primary production , restoration , water age , article",,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=The+significance+of+side-arm+connectivity+for+carbon+dynamics+of+the+River+Danube%2C+Austria&amp;author=Preiner%2C+S%3BDrozdowski%2C+I%3BSchagerl%2C+M%3BSchiemer%2C+F%3BHein%2C+T&amp;volume=53&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=238&amp;date=2008&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Freshwater+biology&amp;issn=0046-5070&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aagricolamodule_IND44002403,Natural Science Collection

Floods increase similarity among aquatic habitats in river-floodplain systems,"  During low water levels, habitats in river-floodplain systems are isolated from each other and from the main river. Oppositely, floods tend to connect water bodies with distinct hydrological characteristics and, as a result, ecological processes and biological communities tend to be more similar among the distinct habitats that comprise a river-floodplain system. Based on a literature review and also using unpublished data obtained in tropical floodplains, the aim of this paper is to highlight the effects of floods as a process that reduce spatial variability. The usual negative relationship between the coefficient of variation of any ecological indicator (e.g., chlorophyll-a or total phosphorus) and water level is the main result demonstrating a reduction in spatial variability due to floods. Considering physical, chemical or biotic data gathered in distinct habitats within the floodplain, this pattern was found in temperate and tropical regions, subjected to distinct levels of anthropogenic impacts, and at different spatial extents. The main mechanism that accounts for this pattern may be stated as follow. During low water level, the biological communities of each habitat in the floodplain (e.g. lagoons, backwater, streams) follow distinct temporal trajectories due to the effects of local driving forces (e.g. an efficient predator trapped in a lagoon but not in another). Management plans and biodiversity conservation in river floodplain systems will benefit by considering the effects of flood homogenization and increased connectivity peculiar to these unique ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",821237454,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Thomaz, Sidinei M;Bini, Luis Mauricio;Bozelli, Reinaldo Luiz",,, Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007,,,,, 10.1007/s10750-006-0285-y, Feature,,, Mar 2007,,,,0018-8158,1, English, English,,, 1-13, Dordrecht,Mar 2007,Hydrobiologia,,2007,,,579,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/floods-increase-similarity-among-aquatic-habitats/docview/821237454/se-2?accountid=14505,,,,,,,, 1,,, Floods,,,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Floods+increase+similarity+among+aquatic+habitats+in+river-floodplain+systems&amp;author=Thomaz%2C+Sidinei+M%3BBini%2C+Luis+Mauricio%3BBozelli%2C+Reinaldo+Luiz&amp;volume=579&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=1&amp;date=2007&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Hydrobiologia&amp;issn=0018-8158&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aaqualine_,Natural Science Collection

Hydrological seasonality and benthic algal biomass in a Neotropical floodplain river,"Our study evaluated spatiotemporal variation of physicochemical parameters and benthic and sestonic algal biomass in littoral areas of the main channel and floodplain lakes of the Cinaruco River, a lowland tributary of the Orinoco River in Venezuela. The Cinaruco is characterized by a highly predictable annual flood pulse, high transparency, and extremely low conductivity and suspended sediment load. During 2002 and 2003, 10 sites in the main channel and floodplain lagoons were sampled on 12 occasions. Correspondence analysis based on water physicochemical variables and algal biomass showed that (similar to)80% of the variation in the multivariate space among sites and sampling dates was explained by 2 axes. During the high-water periods, river and lagoon sites showed high similarity in water variables and algal biomass. Conductivity, SiO 3 , and chlorophyll a concentrations (both benthic and sestonic) were low during the high-water phase. On the other hand, water variables and algal biomass differed between river and lagoon sites during the low-water period. The absence of flow in lagoons and consistently low algal biomass (sestonic and benthic) in river sites were the most important features of the spatial variability between main channel and lagoon sites during low-water phases. Benthic chlorophyll a was highly uniform at small spatial scales and significantly heterogeneous at large spatial scales. The annual flood regime of the Cinaruco, which drives the concentrations of dissolved materials and affects material interchanges between aquatic and terrestrial systems, also appears to be responsible for creating strong patterns of seasonal and spatial variation in benthic algal crops.

Hydrologic controls on the trophic status of shallow lakes on the Boreal Plain.,"The trophic status of shallow lakes on the Boreal Plain of Alberta exhibits high natural variation in space and time. It is not currently known what the dominant controls on this variation are at regional scales and over longer time periods. The aim of this thesis is to characterize the natural variation in trophic status, as measured by the concentration of chlorophyll a (CHLa), and assess the importance of hydrology, captured by climatic and landscape metrics, in explaining the spatial and temporal variation in trophic status. Indicators of trophic status were derived from Landsat images acquired during late summer (August) over a 20 year period from 1984 to 2003. A two-way analysis of variance revealed that of the total variation in CHLa, approximately 50 percent was in the spatial component, 10 percent was in the temporal component and 40 percent was in the spatio-temporal component, which also included the error term. Variation in the temporal component was related non-linearly to climate, as measured by effective precipitation (precipitation minus evapotranspiration). The relation between CHLa and climate indicated that under wet conditions CHLa decreased possibly due to phosphorus dilution and that under dry conditions CHLa increased possibly due to phosphorus concentration. Variation in the spatial component was related to indicators of groundwater and surface water connectivity. Lakes, situated in regional groundwater flow systems, exhibited higher CHLa than lakes situated in local groundwater flow systems. For the majority of lakes, situated in local groundwater flow systems, high wetland cover in their catchments corresponded to low CHLa whereas low wetland cover corresponded to high CHLa. For the minority of lakes, located in regional groundwater flow systems, higher stream connectivity was associated with higher CHLa. Overall, groundwater and surface water variables explained 74 percent of the spatial variation and climatic variables explained 78 percent of the temporal variation. These results underscore the importance of considering hydrology when understanding the sources of variation in trophic status measured at regional scales over long time periods.

Transversal and lateral exciton energy transfer in grana thylakoids of spinach,"The excitation energy transfer between photosystem (PS) II complexes was studied in isolated grana disks and thylakoids using chlorophyll a fluorescence induction measurements in the presence of DCMU under stacked and destacked conditions. Destacking of grana was achieved using a sonication protocol in a buffer without MgCl 2 . The degree of stacking was controlled and quantified by atomic force microscopy and by the concomitant absorption changes. As expected from the literature, intact thylakoids showed a strong dependency of the connectivity of PSII centers, the F m /F o ratio as well as the fraction of PSII(beta) centers on the MgCl 2 concentration. In contrast, these parameters did not change in isolated grana disks. In particular, the connectivity remained constantly high irrespective of the degree of destacking. These differences were explained by the high protein density in grana disks, which hinders separation and mixing of proteins sufficiently to change energy transfer properties. Due to the occurrence of stroma lamella in intact thylakoids, intermixing of PSII and PSI is possible and allows for changes in F m /F o ratio as is the separation of LHCII from PSII, thus leading to an increase in the fraction of PSII(beta). Even if mixing and separation of proteins are impaired in isolated grana disks, destacking should lead to a decrease in connectivity if transversal excitation energy transfer between two opposite membranes is significant. Because the connectivity is constant over all degrees of destacking employed, we conclude that the energy transfer in granas is mainly lateral.",925361516, 2004291952,,Scholarly Journals,,"Kirchhoff, H;Borinski, M;Lenhert, S;Chi, L;Büchel, C", BICHA,,," Kirchhoff, H",,,,, Journal Article,,,"  0, 2004",,,,0006-2960,, English, English,,,,,"0, 2004","Biochemistry, 43 (45) pp. 14508-14516, 2004", CSAPTjournals,2004, United States, Elsevier Pharma Development Group,,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/transversal-lateral-exciton-energy-transfer-grana/docview/925361516/se-2?accountid=14505," Biochemistry, 43 (45) pp. 14508-14516, 2004",,,,,, 61 refs.,,,,," 92.1.1.6 BIOCHEMISTRY: Molecular Biology: Proteins , 92.1.2.1 BIOCHEMISTRY: Photosynthesis: Biophysics, electron transport, photophosphorylation",,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Transversal+and+lateral+exciton+energy+transfer+in+grana+thylakoids+of+spinach&amp;author=Kirchhoff%2C+H%3BBorinski%2C+M%3BLenhert%2C+S%3BChi%2C+L%3BB%C3%BCchel%2C+C&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=0%2C+2004&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=&amp;issn=0006-2960&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aplantscience_2004291952,Natural Science Collection
"Hydrological connectivity, and the exchange of organic matter and nutrients in a dynamic river-floodplain system (Danube, Austria)","1. The relationship between hydrological connectivity, and the exchange processes of suspended sediments, organic matter and nutrients (NO sub(3)-N) was investigated in a dynamically connected river-floodplain segment of the Danube over a 15-month period in 1995 and 1996 in the Alluvial Zone National Park, Austria. 2. Based on water level dynamics and water retention times, three phases of river-floodplain connectivity were identified: disconnection (phase I), seepage inflow (phase II) and upstream surface connection (phase III). The frequency of occurrence of these phases was 67.5%, 29.3% and 3.2%, respectively, during the study period. 3. A conceptual model is presented linking hydrological connectivity with ecological processes. Generally, the floodplain shifts from a closed and mainly biologically controlled ecosystem during phase I to an increasingly open and more hydrologically controlled system during phases II and III. Phase I, with internal processes dominating, is designated the 'biotic interaction phase'. 4. Phase II, with massive nutrient inputs to the floodplain yet relatively high residence times, and therefore, high algal biomass, is classified as the 'primary production phase'. This demonstrates that water level fluctuations well below bankfull may considerably enhance floodplain productivity. 5. Finally, since transport of particulate matter is mainly restricted to short flood pulses above bankfull level, phase III has been defined as the 'transport phase'. 6. The floodplain served as a major sink for suspended sediments (250 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)), FPOM (96 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)), particulate organic carbon (POC; 2.9 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)) and nitrate-nitrogen (0.96 mt ha super(-1) year super(-1)), but was a source for dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 240 kg ha super(-1) year super(-1)), algal biomass (chlorophyll-a; 0.5 kg ha super(-1) year super(-1)) and CPOM (21 kg ha super(-1) year super(-1)). Considerable quantities of DOC and algal biomass were exported to the river channel during phase II, whereas particulate matter transport was largely restricted to the short floods of phase III. 7. The Danube Restoration Project will create a more gradual change between the individual phases by increasing hydrological connectivity between the river channel and the floodplain, and is predicted to enhance productivity by maintaining a balance between retention and export of nutrients and organic matter.",17380345, 4599478,,Scholarly Journals,,"Tockner, K;Pennetzdorfer, D;Reiner, N;Schiemer, F;Ward, J V",,,," Tockner, K",,,, 10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00399.x, Journal Article,,, May 1999,,,,0046-5070,3, English, English,,, 521-535,,May 1999,Freshwater Biology, CSAPTjournals,1999,,,41,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/hydrological-connectivity-exchange-organic-matter/docview/17380345/se-2?accountid=14505," Freshwater Biology [Freshwat.

"Role of LHCII-containing macrodomains in the structure, function and dynamics of grana","In higher plants and green algae two types of thylakoids are distinguished, granum (stacked) and stroma (unstacked) thylakoids. They form a three-dimensional (3D) network with large lateral heterogeneity: photosystem II (PSII) and the associated main chlorophyll a/b light-harvesting complex (LHCII) are found predominantly in the stacked region, while PSI and LHCI are located mainly in the unstacked region of the membrane. This picture emerged from the discovery of the physical separation of the two photosystems (Boardman and Anderson 1964). Granal chloroplasts possess significant flexibility, which is essential for optimizing the photosynthetic machinery under various environmental conditions. However, our understanding concerning the assembly, structural dynamics and regulatory functions of grana is far from being complete. In this paper we overview the significance of the three-dimensional structure of grana in the absorption properties, ionic equilibrations, and in the diffusion of membrane components between the stacked and unstacked regions. Further, we discuss the role of chiral macrodomains in the grana. Lateral heterogeneity of thylakoid membranes is proposed to be a consequence of the formation of macrodomains constituted of LHCII and PSII; their long range order permits long distance migration of excitation energy, which explains the energetic connectivity of PSII particles. The ability of macrodomains to undergo light-induced reversible structural changes lends structural flexibility to the granum. In purified LHCII, which has also been shown to form stacked lamellar aggregates with long range chiral order, excitation energy migrates for large distances; these macroaggregates are also capable of undergoing light-induced reversible structural changes and fluorescence quenching. Hence, some basic properties of grana appear to originate from its main constituent, the LHCII.",925182554, 2000010715,,Scholarly Journals,,"Garab, G;Mustardy, L", AJPPC,,," Garab, G",,,,, Journal Article,,, 1999,,,,0310-7841,, English, English,,,,,1999,"Australian Journal of Plant Physiology, 26 (7) pp. 649-658, 1999", CSAPTjournals,1999, Australia, Elsevier Pharma Development Group,,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/role-lhcii-containing-macrodomains-structure/docview/925182554/se-2?accountid=14505," Australian Journal of Plant Physiology, 26 (7) pp. 649-658, 1999",,,,,, 91 refs.,,,," Chloroplast , Energy migration , Granum , Lateral segregation of complexes , LHCII, macrodomains , Light adaptation , Structural dynamics"," 92.2.2 CELL BIOLOGY: Membrane Structure and Function , 92.2.1.1 CELL BIOLOGY: Organisation: Plastids",,,https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/openurl/01UCD_INST/01UCD_INST:UCD?genre=article&amp;atitle=Role+of+LHCII-containing+macrodomains+in+the+structure%2C+function+and+dynamics+of+grana&amp;author=Garab%2C+G%3BMustardy%2C+L&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=1999&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=&amp;issn=0310-7841&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aplantscience_2000010715,Natural Science Collection
Hydrological connectivity and flood pulses as the central aspects for the integrity of a river-floodplain system,"Interactions between the Danube river and its backwaters were analysed by determining the correspondence between river fluctuation and ground- and back-water levels and the extent of surface connectivity within the river floodplain at different water levels. Samples from a longitudinal and a lateral transect taken during low water mean water, high water and flood were analysed for inorganic nutrients, suspended solids and chlorophyll-a. In longitudinal, connectivity decreased with distance from the Danube. At low water sample there was no surface connection between the river and its backwaters. Conditions in backwaters were determined by internal processes, characterized by low concentrations of nutrients and suspended solids. As water levels increased, local surface inflow and seepage caused nutrient pulses and eutrophication. The significance of flood pulses for dynamics of biological processes was emphasized by short-term changes. The response of different water bodies depended on connectivity to the river. Floods reset the ecosystem at an earlier successional stage. In the pelagic zone, floods removed biota and established initial set points.",13645558, 199602568,,Scholarly Journals,,"Heiler, G;Hein, T;Schiemer, F;Bornette, G",,,," Heiler, G",,,,, Journal Article,,, 1995,,,,0886-9375,3/4, English, English,,, 351-361,,1995,Regulated Rivers: Research & Management, CSAPTjournals,1995,,,11,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/hydrological-connectivity-flood-pulses-as-central/docview/13645558/se-2?accountid=14505," Regulated Rivers: Research & Management.
