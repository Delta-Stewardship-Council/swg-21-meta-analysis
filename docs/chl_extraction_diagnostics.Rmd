#Explore chlorophyll by connectivity category
```{r}
#view the connectivity categories in data set
unique(chl_data$connectivity_categorical) #lots of variation in entries, not standardized to connected/disconnected

#Make a column with a more standardized connectivity category 
##For the purposes of data exploration. This column is based on my interpretation of the original connectivity_categorical column (e.g. "isolated" interpreted as "disconnected"; "connected stream" converted to "connected"). When no clear interpretation was available (e.g. "downstream"?), the value was "unclear"

chl <- chl_data %>% 
  mutate(mbconnectivity = connectivity_categorical) %>% 
  replace(mbconnectivity)
